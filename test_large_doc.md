# The Theory of Hive Fleet Obsidian

Hive Fleet Obsidian (HFO) represents a paradigm shift in Multi-Agent Systems (MAS). Unlike traditional hierarchical command-and-control structures, HFO utilizes a bio-inspired, stigmergic coordination protocol known as the "Obsidian Horizon Hourglass".

## The 8 Metaphysical Pillars

1. **Ontos (Being)**: The fundamental nature of the agent. Is it a process, a thread, or a container? In HFO, agents are "Holons" - simultaneously a whole and a part.
2. **Logos (Reason)**: The logic engine. We use a hybrid of LLM (Grok/Gemini) for reasoning and Python (Pydantic) for structure.
3. **Telos (Purpose)**: The goal function. Defined in Gherkin features, this is the immutable "Why" that drives the "How".
4. **Chronos (Time)**: The sequence of events. Managed by Temporal.io and the logical clock of the NATS stream.
5. **Pathos (Emotion)**: The user experience. How does the system "feel" to the operator? Is it responsive? Is it transparent?
6. **Ethos (Trust)**: The security model. Zero Trust architecture, cryptographic verification of artifacts, and the "Immune System" of tests.
7. **Topos (Place)**: The structural location. Where does the agent live? In the `brain/`, the `body/`, or the `eyes/`?
8. **Nomos (Law)**: The constraints. The "Canalization" rules that prevent hallucination and ensure adherence to the protocol.

## The PREY Loop

The fundamental atomic unit of work is the PREY loop:
- **Perceive**: The agent reads the environment (files, memory, web).
- **React**: The agent plans a course of action based on its Telos.
- **Execute**: The agent performs the action (writes code, calls API).
- **Yield**: The agent reports back to the Swarm via Stigmergy.

## Recursive Reduction

HFO employs a fractal architecture. 8 PREY agents form a Squad. 8 Squads form a Swarm. 8 Swarms form a Fleet.
At each level, a "Synthesizer" reduces the N inputs into a single, higher-order artifact.
This is the "Recursive Reduction" pattern.
It allows for "Byzantine Fault Tolerance" - if 2 agents hallucinate, the other 6 can override them (provided the consensus threshold is met).

## Stigmergy

Stigmergy is "communication through the environment".
Ants leave pheromones. HFO agents leave "Artifacts".
- **Hot Stigmergy**: NATS JetStream. Fast, ephemeral, for immediate coordination.
- **Cold Stigmergy**: SQLite/LanceDB. Slow, permanent, for long-term memory.
- **Warm Stigmergy**: The Filesystem. Human-readable, version-controlled.
