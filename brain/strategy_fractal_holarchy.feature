Feature: Fractal Holarchy Strategy
  As the Swarmlord
  I want to organize the Hive into a Fractal Holarchy
  So that the system can scale infinitely while maintaining coherence.

  Scenario: Recursive Structure
    Given the Hive is operational
    When a "Holon" (Agent or Squad) is inspected
    Then it should contain a "Brain" (Navigator), "Body" (Workers), and "Memory" (Assimilator)
    And this structure should repeat at every level (L0 Agent -> L1 Squad -> L2 Swarm).

  Scenario: Temporal Dilation
    Given the Fractal Holarchy
    When moving up a level (L0 -> L1)
    Then the "Time Horizon" should expand (Seconds -> Minutes)
    And the "Context Window" should broaden (Task -> Mission).
