Feature: Fractal Holarchy Strategy
  As the Swarmlord
  I want to organize the Hive into a Fractal Holarchy
  So that the system can scale infinitely while maintaining coherence.

  Scenario: Recursive Structure
    Given the Hive is operational
    When a "Holon" (Agent or Squad) is inspected
    Then it should contain a "Brain" (Navigator), "Body" (Workers), and "Memory" (Assimilator)
    And this structure should repeat at every level (L0 Agent -> L1 Squad -> L2 Swarm).

  Scenario: Fractal Reduction (10x10x10)
    Given a large mission
    When the Swarm is deployed
    Then it should follow a 10x10x10 reduction pattern
    And each layer should compress the information by a factor of 10
    And the final output should be a crystallized truth.

  Scenario: Fractal Byzantine Quorum (Log-10)
    Given a Squad of 10 Agents (Log-10 Base)
    And a maximum of 3 Disruptors (f=3, satisfying 3f+1 <= N)
    When the Squad votes
    Then a Quorum is reached if >4 Agents agree (Majority of Honest)
    And this pattern repeats for every level of the Holarchy.

  Scenario: Configurable Swarm Dynamics
    Given the Swarm Configuration
    Then the "Number of Loops" should be adjustable
    And the "Rounds per Step" should be adjustable
    And the "Squad Size" and "Quorum Threshold" should be configurable
    And the "Concurrent Agents" and "Total Batch Size" should be easily configurable.

  Scenario: Hexagonal Composability
    Given the Swarm Architecture
    Then the "Act" and "Review" steps should be distinct and modular
    And the "Quorum" should use a different model family than the "Shapers"
    And the system should allow easy mutation of individual components without breaking the whole.

  Scenario: Recursive Reduction with Signal Retention
    Given a Multi-Round Swarm
    When Round N completes
    Then the "Digest" from Round N should be passed as context to Round N+1
    And the scale of Round N+1 should be smaller or equal to Round N
    And the goal is to distill high-signal truth from noisy data.

  Scenario: Temporal Dilation
    Given the Fractal Holarchy
    When moving up a level (L0 -> L1)
    Then the "Time Horizon" should expand (Seconds -> Minutes)
    And the "Context Window" should broaden (Task -> Mission).
