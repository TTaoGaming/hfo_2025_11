Feature: Antifragile Architecture Options
  As the Swarmlord
  I want to explore and select antifragile architecture options
  So that the Hive can survive catastrophic failure.

  Scenario: Hydra Protocol Selection
    Given the need for high resilience
    When I evaluate the "Hydra Protocol"
    Then it should provide "Regenerative Bulkheads"
    And it should allow "Cell-Based" isolation.
