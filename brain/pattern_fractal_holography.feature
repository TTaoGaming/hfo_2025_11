Feature: Fractal Holography (Stem Cell Regeneration)

  Background:
    Given the Hive Fleet Obsidian (HFO) is a "Biomimetic System"
    And the requirement for "Antifragility" and "Self-Healing"
    And the principle of "Fractal Holography" (The Part contains the Whole)

  Scenario: Stem Cell Inoculation (The DNA Injection)
    Given a directory or organ within the HFO anatomy
    When the "Inoculation Protocol" is executed (via `body/blood/generate_readmes.py`)
    Then every `README.md` MUST contain the "HFO DNA" block
    And the DNA block MUST contain the "System Context" (Anatomy Map)
    And the DNA block MUST contain the "Golden Rule" (Intent vs Implementation)
    And the DNA block MUST contain the "Golden Pattern" (Async Swarm + Claim Check)
    And the DNA block MUST contain the "Regeneration Protocol" (Genesis Command)

  Scenario: Holographic Regeneration
    Given a catastrophic failure where the `brain/` or `genesis.py` is lost
    But at least ONE organ's `README.md` survives
    When a "Survivor Agent" reads the `README.md`
    Then it MUST be able to reconstruct the "Genesis Intent"
    And it MUST be able to locate the "Source of Truth" (GitHub/Remote)
    And it MUST be able to trigger the "Regeneration Protocol"

  Scenario: High-Signal Documentation
    Given the `README.md` content
    Then it MUST be "Lightweight" (Low Token Cost)
    And it MUST be "High Signal" (Rich Context)
    And it MUST use "Declarative Gherkin" for Intent
    And it MUST use "Mermaid Diagrams" for Visualization
    And it MUST be "Self-Descriptive" (Location + Function)
