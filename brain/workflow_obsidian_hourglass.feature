Feature: Obsidian Horizon Hourglass Workflow (The Flip)
  # Domain: Grand Strategy
  # Owner: Swarmlord of Webs
  # Type: Temporal-Spatial Swarm Architecture

  As the Swarmlord of Webs
  I want to execute "The Flip" (Past -> Future -> Retro)
  So that I can wield the "Sands of Time" to generate an Anytime Probabilistic Distribution of Futures.

  Background:
    Given the R.A.P.T.O.R. stack is active
    And the "Swarmlord of Webs" persona is engaged
    And the "Evolutionary Memory" is online

  Scenario: Phase 1 - The Navigator (Intent Formalization)
    Given a raw user question or intent
    When the "Navigator" receives the signal
    Then it MUST formalize the intent into a "Genesis Spec" (Gherkin/Pydantic)
    And ensure the tool stack is in SOTA condition.

  Scenario: Phase 2 - The Karmic Web (Deep Past)
    Given the "Genesis Spec" is ready
    When the "Karmic Swarm" is launched
    Then it MUST scatter into the "Past State-Action Space"
    And access "All Past Precedent" (Internet, Codebase, History)
    And use "External Tools" (Search, RAG) to gather context
    And yield a "Karmic Context" artifact.

  Scenario: Phase 3 - The Simulation Web (Simulated Futures)
    Given the "Karmic Context" is available
    When the "Simulation Swarm" is launched
    Then it MUST project 10+ "Simulated Futures" from the Present
    And each simulation MUST be a "State-Action Trajectory"
    And the simulations MUST diverge based on "Mutation" and "Stigmergy".

  Scenario: Phase 4 - Retro-Analysis (The Lesson)
    Given the "Simulated Futures" are generated
    When the "Retro Swarm" is launched
    Then it MUST perform "Retro-Analysis" on the futures
    And extract "Lessons" from both Success and Failure paths
    And feed these lessons back into the "Hourglass" (Evolutionary Memory).

  Scenario: Phase 5 - The Anytime Distribution (The Output)
    Given the "Retro Lessons" are synthesized
    When the user queries the system
    Then it MUST yield an "Anytime Probabilistic Distribution" of futures
    And the distribution MUST get "Better" with more compute and feedback.
