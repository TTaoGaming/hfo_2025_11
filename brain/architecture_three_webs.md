# 🕸️ The Three Webs: Advanced Cognitive Architecture

> **Status**: Draft (Gen 51 Vision)
> **Context**: Evolution of the "Obsidian Horizon Hourglass" into a Hexagonal Hyper-Heuristic System.

## 1. The Karmic Web (Past / Context)
**"The Hunter of Precedents"**

*   **Core Philosophy**: Never start from zero. Use Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) to find the closest matching "case" from history.
*   **Methodologies**:
    *   **Cynefin Framework**: Categorize the problem domain (Simple, Complicated, Complex, Chaotic) to select the right search strategy.
    *   **Exemplar Hunting**: Actively search for "Exemplars" in:
        *   **Biomimicry**: How does nature solve this? (e.g., Slime molds for routing).
        *   **Open Source**: What GitHub repos already do this?
        *   **Industry Standards**: What is the "boring solution"?
*   **Mechanism**: RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) + Graph Traversal.

## 2. The Present Swarm Web (Action / Execution)
**"The Engine of Now"**

*   **Core Philosophy**: Durable, Concurrent, Anytime.
*   **Methodologies**:
    *   **Temporal / Durable Execution**: Workflows that cannot die. If a node fails, it retries. If the system crashes, it resumes.
    *   **Concurrency**: Massive parallelism. Not just "batching", but true async scatter-gather.
    *   **Anytime Algorithms**: The system can produce a valid result *at any moment*, but the quality improves with time.
*   **Mechanism**: Temporal.io (Orchestration) + Ray (Compute) + NATS (Signaling).

## 3. The Simulation Web (Future / Evolution)
**"The Forge of Possibilities"**

*   **Core Philosophy**: Divergent Evolution and Quality-Diversity (QD).
*   **Methodologies**:
    *   **Quality-Diversity (QD)**: Use `pyribs` (MAP-Elites) to find solutions that are not just "good", but "diverse" and "high-performing".
    *   **DSPy / Test-Time Compute**: Optimize the *prompts* and *reasoning traces* themselves.
    *   **Co-Evolution**:
        *   **Venom (Disruptors)**: Agents specifically designed to break the system (Red Team).
        *   **Immune System**: Agents designed to patch the breaks (Blue Team).
*   **Mechanism**: Evolutionary Algorithms (OpenEvolve/PyRibs) running in background threads (Ray Actors).

## 🏷️ Formal Naming Candidates

**The Obsidian Hex-Hive**
*   *Why*: Hexagonal architecture (Ports & Adapters) meets Hive mind.

**Hyper-Heuristic Horizon (H3)**
*   *Why*: Emphasizes the "Hyper-Heuristic" nature of evolving the algorithms themselves.

**The Panarchic Loop**
*   *Why*: In ecology, "Panarchy" describes the interplay between change and persistence (Adaptive Cycles).
