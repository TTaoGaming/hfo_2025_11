Feature: Trust Engine (Byzantine Quorum)
  As the Disruptor (Red Team)
  I want to challenge the Hive's decisions
  So that only robust truths survive.

  Scenario: Byzantine Quorum
    Given a critical decision (e.g., Code Merge, Strategic Pivot)
    When the "Council" convenes
    Then it must consist of N=10 agents
    And f=3 agents must be "Disruptors" (Adversarial)
    And the decision requires 2f+1 (7) consensus to pass.

  Scenario: Hidden Disruptor Injection
    Given a "Cohort" of agents is formed
    When the "Initial Quorum" (Round 1) begins
    Then the Disruptors should remain "Hidden" (acting as Observers)
    But when the "Second Iteration" (Round 2) begins
    Then the Disruptors should "Reveal" themselves and attack the consensus
    And this should create "Evolutionary Pressure" for the Immunizers to defend the truth.

  Scenario: MAP-Elites Evolution
    Given the Trust Engine is active
    When a strategy fails or succeeds
    Then the "Evolutionary Forge" should update the "Archive"
    And it should mutate the prompts/weights of the agents
    And it should select for "Quality" and "Diversity".
