Feature: Gen 52 Octree Fractal Holarchy
  As the Swarmlord
  I want to align the Hive Fleet Architecture to a Base-8 (Octal) System
  So that I achieve perfect fractal self-similarity, digital resonance, and cognitive clarity.

  Background:
    Given the "Obsidian" identity implies an 8-fold structure
    And the "Holon" must be isomorphic at all scales
    And "Octrees" are the optimal data structure for 3D spatial knowledge mapping

  Scenario: The Octet (Fundamental Unit)
    Given a standard "Squad" (L1 Holon)
    Then it MUST be composed of exactly 8 Core Roles (The Octet)
    And the roles MUST map to the O.B.S.I.D.I.A.N. acronym:
      | Letter | Role        | Organ      | Stigmergy Dimension | Cognitive Metaphor |
      | O      | Observer    | Eyes       | Ontos (Being)       | Perception         |
      | B      | Bridger     | Nerves     | Logos (Connection)  | Translation        |
      | S      | Shaper      | Hands      | Techne (Craft)      | Action             |
      | I      | Injector    | Blood      | Chronos (Time)      | Flow               |
      | D      | Disruptor   | Venom      | Pathos (Conflict)   | Truth              |
      | I      | Immunizer   | Carapace   | Ethos (Trust)       | Defense            |
      | A      | Assimilator | Digestion  | Topos (Structure)   | Integration        |
      | N      | Navigator   | Brain      | Telos (Purpose)     | Direction          |

  Scenario: The Octree (Scaling Law)
    Given the Hive scales recursively
    When a node expands
    Then it MUST branch into 8 children (Powers of 8)
    And the hierarchy levels are defined as:
      | Level | Name    | Count (8^n) | Analogy | Purpose                  |
      | L0    | Bit     | 1           | Agent   | The Atomic Unit          |
      | L1    | Byte    | 8           | Squad   | The Functional Unit      |
      | L2    | Word    | 64          | Phalanx | Tactical Coordination    |
      | L3    | Page    | 512         | Legion  | Strategic Operations     |
      | L4    | Block   | 4096        | Hive    | Global Domination        |
      | L5    | Grid    | 32768       | Fleet   | Interstellar Scale       |

  Scenario: The Morphic Octet (Time-Division Multiplexing)
    Given the "Morphic Octet" pattern is active
    When the Swarm enters a specific phase (e.g., Watch, Act)
    Then ALL 8 Agents in the Octet MUST shift to the same Role
    And they MUST execute the phase in parallel (Batch Processing)
    And the concurrency limit MUST be a power of 8 (8, 16, 32, 64)

  Scenario: Stigmergic Dimensions (The 8-Fold Header)
    Given an artifact or file in the Hive
    Then it MUST possess an "Octarchy Header" with 8 Dimensions
    And the dimensions MUST correspond to the 8 Pillars:
      1. Ontos (Identity/Type/Owner)
      2. Logos (Links/Protocol)
      3. Techne (Tools/Methods)
      4. Chronos (Timestamp/Urgency)
      5. Pathos (Status/Risk)
      6. Ethos (Permissions/Hash)
      7. Topos (Address/Path)
      8. Telos (Goal/Meme)
