# 🔬 Research: Obsidian Physics & Stigmergy Mapping

> **Status**: Active Research (Gen 52)
> **Source**: Wikipedia, Mindat.org, Geology.com
> **Goal**: Establish a scientifically rigorous metaphor for HFO Stigmergy based on the actual properties of Volcanic Glass.

## 1. The Real Science of Obsidian

### 1.1 Composition & State
*   **Material**: Felsic Lava (High Silica, SiO₂ > 70%).
*   **State**: **Mineraloid** (Amorphous Solid). It is a "Super-cooled Liquid".
*   **Structure**: Lacks a crystalline lattice. This is the defining feature.
*   **Melting Point**: **700°C – 1,050°C** (Rhyolitic Magma).

### 1.2 Formation (The Quench)
*   **Process**: Occurs when lava cools **so rapidly** that atoms cannot arrange into crystals.
*   **Constraint**: If cooled slowly, it becomes **Rhyolite** (Granite equivalent) which is grainy and useless for sharp tools.
*   **HFO Mapping**: We must capture the "Stream of Thought" (Magma) instantly into "Markdown" (Glass). If we try to force it into SQL (Crystal) too early, we lose the "Sharpness" (Fidelity).

### 1.3 Mechanical Properties (Knapping)
*   **Fracture**: **Conchoidal** (Shell-like, curved).
*   **Sharpness**: Cutting edge can be **3 nanometers** thick (sharper than surgical steel).
*   **Process**: **Knapping** (Lithic Reduction). A "Hammerstone" strikes a "Core" to remove a "Flake".
*   **HFO Mapping**: The **Assimilator** (Hammerstone) strikes the **File** (Core) to extract a **Vector** (Flake). The Flake is the "Tool" used for search.

### 1.4 Aging (Devitrification & Hydration)
*   **Devitrification**: Over time, glass is unstable. It naturally crystallizes into **Cristobalite** (Spherulites), forming "Snowflake Obsidian". This makes it brittle and useless for tools.
*   **Hydration**: Obsidian absorbs water from the air, forming a "Hydration Rind". This is used for dating artifacts.
*   **HFO Mapping**:
    *   **Devitrification**: "Bit Rot". Unmaintained files lose context and become noise.
    *   **Hydration**: "Backlinks". A file accumulates links over time. A thick "Link Rind" proves age and value.

## 2. The HFO Stigmergy Map (Scientific)

| HFO Component | Geological Equivalent | Temp / State | Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **NATS JetStream** | **Rhyolitic Magma** | **900°C (Melt)** | **Flow**. High viscosity, high energy. |
| **Redis Buffer** | **Lava Dome** | **700°C (Viscous)** | **Pool**. Cooling but still fluid. |
| **Markdown File** | **Obsidian Core** | **20°C (Glass)** | **Storage**. Amorphous, potential energy. |
| **Assimilator** | **Hammerstone** | **N/A (Mechanical)** | **Strike**. Kinetic force applied to Core. |
| **Vector Embedding** | **Razor Flake** | **20°C (Glass)** | **Cut**. The sharpest unit of meaning. |
| **Knowledge Graph** | **Composite Tool** | **20°C (Assembly)** | **Bind**. Flakes hafted together. |
| **Backlinks** | **Hydration Rind** | **Time Factor** | **Age**. Accumulation of context. |

### 💡 Key Corrections from Previous Models
1.  **No Plasma**: Obsidian forms from Melt, not Plasma.
2.  **No Cold Tools**: The Tool is the same temperature as the Core. The transformation is **Mechanical** (Knapping), not Thermal.
3.  **Glass vs Crystal**: We explicitly want **Glass** (Markdown) for storage because it holds infinite potential (Conchoidal Fracture). **Crystal** (SQL) is grainy and limits how we can "cut" the data later.

## 3. The "Obsidian Cycle" (Revised)

1.  **Eruption (Hot)**: User Intent flows as Magma (NATS).
2.  **Quench (Transition)**: We freeze the Magma into a Markdown File (Obsidian Core).
3.  **Knap (Cold)**: The Assimilator strikes the Core to create Vectors (Flakes).
4.  **Haft (Assembly)**: We bind Vectors into a Knowledge Graph (Tool).
5.  **Hydrate (Aging)**: The Core accumulates Backlinks (Rind) over time.
