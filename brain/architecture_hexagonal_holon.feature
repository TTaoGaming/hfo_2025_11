Feature: Hexagonal Holon Architecture (The Universal Adapter)
  """
  The Hexagonal Holon is the fundamental "Cell" of Hive Fleet Obsidian.
  It is a biomimetic, fractal data structure designed to facilitate:
  1. Exemplar Adoption (Absorbing external patterns).
  2. Meta-Evolution (Evolving the structure itself).
  3. Apex Adaptation (Dominating any domain via mimicry).
  """

  As a Swarmlord of the Fractal Holarchy
  I want a biomimetic, hexagonal data structure
  So that I can adapt to any domain, evolve via meta-algorithms, and enforce intent across all scales

  Background: The 6 Dimensions of the Holon
    Given the "Hexagonal Holon" standard is active
    And the 6 dimensions are defined as the "Universal Interface":
      | Dimension | Concept | Purpose              |
      | North     | Ontos   | Identity & Type      |
      | South     | Telos   | Purpose & Intent     |
      | East      | Chronos | Time & Energy        |
      | West      | Topos   | Space & Connectivity |
      | Up        | Logos   | Logic & Truth        |
      | Down      | Pathos  | Quality & Sentiment  |

  Scenario: Exemplar Adoption (The Borg Pattern)
    """
    The Swarm encounters a superior external pattern (e.g., K8s Manifests, CloudEvents).
    Instead of rejecting it, the Hexagon adapts to it, absorbing its strength.
    """
    Given a new "Exemplar Pattern" is discovered in the environment
    And the pattern offers a "Survival Advantage" (Efficiency, Speed, Robustness)
    When the Swarm initiates the "Assimilation Protocol"
    Then the Hexagon acts as a "Polymorphic Adapter"
    And it maps the external pattern's fields to the 6 Internal Dimensions
    And the Swarm gains the capability of the Exemplar without losing its own Identity (Ontos)

  Scenario: Meta-Evolutionary Optimization (The Genetic Forge)
    """
    The Swarm does not just evolve agents; it evolves the Architecture itself.
    The Hexagon is the genotype for the Meta-Evolutionary Algorithm.
    """
    Given a population of "Hexagonal Holons" in the "Evolutionary Forge"
    And a "Meta-Objective" is defined (e.g., Maximize Stigmergy, Minimize Latency)
    When the "Meta-Evolutionary Algorithm" (MAP-Elites) executes
    Then it mutates the "Telos" (Strategy) and "Topos" (Topology) of the Holons
    And it selects the fittest configurations based on "Pathos" (Quality Metrics)
    And the winning Hexagon becomes the new "Apex Genotype" for the next generation

  Scenario: Biomimetic Domain Adaptation (The Apex Predator)
    """
    The Swarm enters a new domain (e.g., Finance, Cyber, Bio).
    It mimics the dominant strategies of that domain to become the Apex.
    """
    Given the Swarm enters a new "Target Domain"
    And the domain has specific "Environmental Constraints" (Tempo, Physics, Rules)
    When the "Biomimicry Engine" analyzes the domain's "Apex Predators"
    Then it adapts the Hexagon's "Chronos" (Tempo) and "Logos" (Logic) to match the environment
    And the Swarm achieves "Symbiotic Resonance" with the domain
    But the "Ontos" (Identity) remains invariant (The Swarm is still the Swarm)

  Scenario: Fractal Holarchy Consistency (The Hologram)
    """
    The structure must be identical at the Micro (Code) and Macro (Strategy) levels.
    """
    Given a "Strategic Intent" at Level 1 (The Brain)
    When it propagates down to Level 3 (The Hands)
    Then the "Hexagonal Structure" remains self-similar (Fractal)
    And the "Telos" of the L3 Holon is a direct child of the L1 Holon
    And the "Topos" links preserve the lineage (Traceability)
    And the "Pathos" of the part contributes to the "Pathos" of the whole
