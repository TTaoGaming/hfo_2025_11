Feature: Tectangle Vision Validation and Warchest Strategy
  As the Swarmlord
  I want to validate the "Hypercasual Game Forge with Gesture Controls" vision
  So that I can build a sustainable Warchest and achieve Total Tool Virtualization.

  Scenario: Validate Market Viability of Gesture-Based Hypercasual Games
    Given the "Tectangle" concept (Predictive Physics Pinch, Gesture Controls)
    And the "Hypercasual Game Forge" capability (Evolutionary generation)
    When I deploy a Research Swarm of 100 agents
    Then the swarm should analyze market trends for "Skill Transfer" and "Local Multiplayer"
    And the swarm should produce a Byzantine Consensus on the viability of this niche
    And the swarm should identify "Blue Ocean" opportunities where Gesture Controls provide a 10x advantage.

  Scenario: Define Warchest Monetization Strategy
    Given the HFO technical stack (Swarm Orchestration, R.A.P.T.O.R.)
    And the user's capability as a top-tier Swarm Orchestrator
    When I analyze monetization paths for "Indie Dev Support" and "Tool Licensing"
    Then the swarm should recommend 3 concrete revenue streams (e.g., Game Sales, SaaS Forge, Asset Licensing)
    And the swarm should prioritize paths that fund the "Total Tool Virtualization" roadmap.

  Scenario: Execute Large-Scale Consensus
    Given a swarm configuration of 100 agents (Holonic/Fractal)
    When the "Tectangle Validation" mission is executed
    Then the system should handle 1000+ agent calls per hour
    And the final output should be a "Quorum Digest" with >90% confidence.
