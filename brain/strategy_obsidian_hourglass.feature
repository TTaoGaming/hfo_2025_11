Feature: Obsidian Hourglass Strategy
  As the Swarmlord (Navigator)
  I want to use the Obsidian Hourglass algorithm
  So that I can traverse the Past, Present, and Future to make optimal decisions.

  Scenario: Temporal Traversal
    Given a strategic decision is required
    When the "Obsidian Hourglass" is activated
    Then the system should query the "Past" (Karmic Web) for precedents
    And the system should orchestrate the "Present" (Neck) for execution
    And the system should simulate the "Future" (Simulation Web) for tail risks
    And the "Anytime Algorithm" should allow stopping at any moment for the best current path.

  Scenario: The Flip
    Given the Hourglass is running
    When the "Present" execution yields new data
    Then the system should "Flip" the Hourglass
    And the "Future" simulations should become "Past" precedents for the next cycle.
