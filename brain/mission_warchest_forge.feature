Feature: Warchest Forge & Vision Validation
  As the Overmind (TTao)
  I want to validate the "Hypercasual Game Forge" vision with "Gesture Controls"
  So that I can build a financial "Warchest" to support my liberation and development.

  Background:
    Given the "Obsidian Horizon Hourglass" strategy is active
    And the "Tectangle" gesture architecture is defined in Gen 28
    And the "Hypercasual Market" analysis (Gen 51) indicates a pivot to "Smart Hyper"

  Scenario: Validate Gesture-Based Skill Transfer
    Given a research swarm of 50 agents
    When they analyze the intersection of "Hypercasual Games" and "Tectangle Gesture Controls"
    Then they must determine if "Real Skill Transfer" is viable in a mobile form factor
    And they must identify "Local Multiplayer" mechanics that drive viral growth
    And they must produce a "Go/No-Go" verdict on the "Gesture Forge" product strategy

  Scenario: Warchest Revenue Strategy
    Given the need for "Financial Sovereignty"
    When the swarm analyzes "Monetization Models" for AI-driven games
    Then they must identify "Blue Ocean" niches for a solo developer
    And they must propose a "Revenue Pipeline" (Ads, IAP, Licensing, SaaS)
    And they must map "Current Tech Stack" (HFO, Swarms) to "Immediate Income" opportunities
