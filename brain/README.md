# 🧠 Hive Fleet Obsidian: The Brain (Gen 51)

> **Status**: Active (Phoenix Protocol Executed)
> **Generation**: 51 (The Crystal Forge)
> **Focus**: Intent-Based Engineering & Knowledge Graph RAG

## 🦅 Overview
This is the command center of Hive Fleet Obsidian. It contains the **Intent** (What & Why) of the system.

### 📜 The Golden Rule
1.  **Intent**: Defined here in Gherkin (`.feature`) and Markdown (`.md`).
2.  **Implementation**: Executed in `body/` by the Swarm.

### 🧬 Structure
*   `registry.yaml`: The biological map of the Hive.
*   `concepts.yaml`: The registry of active Intent concepts.
*   `*.feature`: Gherkin definitions.
*   `*.md`: Executive summaries with Mermaid diagrams.

## 🕸️ Memory Link
The previous generation (Gen 50) has been crystallized into `memory/semantic/library/`.
