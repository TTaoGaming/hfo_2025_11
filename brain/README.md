## 🧬 Biological Function
The **Brain** is the seat of **Intent** and **Strategy**. It does not execute code; it defines *what* must be done. It holds the "Holocron" (Registry) and the Gherkin feature files that define the behavior of the entire Hive.

## 📂 Contents
*   **Feature Files (`*.feature`)**: The Gherkin specifications defining the "Why" and "What".
*   **Registry (`registry.yaml`)**: The Single Source of Truth (SSOT) for the Hive's anatomy.
*   **Architecture (`*.mmd`, `*.md`)**: High-level maps and diagrams.

## 🤖 Agent Instructions
*   **Read-Only**: Do not modify files here unless you are updating the Grand Strategy.
*   **Validation**: All actions in the `body/` must trace back to an intent defined here.
