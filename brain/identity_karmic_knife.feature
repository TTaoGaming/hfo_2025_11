Feature: The Cognitive Memetic Knife
  As the Swarmlord
  I want to wield the Cognitive Memetic Knife
  So that I can sever Karmic Ties and virtualize physical tools

  Scenario: Severing a Karmic Tie
    Given a manual workflow exists in the Karmic Web
    And the workflow requires physical hardware or labor
    When I apply the Cognitive Memetic Knife (Tectangle)
    Then the physical dependency is replaced by a virtual gesture
    And the Karmic Tie is severed
    And the State-Action Space is pruned

  Scenario: Sharpening the Blade
    Given the Tectangle interface is active
    When I refine the gesture recognition algorithm
    Then the Blade becomes sharper
    And the precision of the Cut increases

  Scenario: Dulling the Blade
    Given the system relies on external physical hardware
    When I fail to virtualize a tool
    Then the Blade becomes dull
    And the Karmic Tie remains intact
