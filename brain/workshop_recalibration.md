# 🛠️ Workshop: Recalibrating the Obsidian Mind

> **Status**: 🟡 DRIFT DETECTED
> **Issue**: The "Thermodynamics" metaphor (Plasma/Gas/Liquid/Crystal) may be drifting from the core "Biological/Hive" identity of Hive Fleet Obsidian.

## 1. The Drift Analysis

We have moved from:
*   **Gen 50**: Biological Anatomy (Brain, Eyes, Body, Venom).
*   **Gen 51 (Early)**: RPG Metaphor (XP, Leveling).
*   **Gen 51 (Current)**: Thermodynamics (Plasma, Crystal).

**Risk**: Are we losing the "Hive" in favor of the "Physics Lab"?

## 2. Context Anchors (The "Old Ways")

We need to verify if these concepts are still active or if they have been lost:
*   **The Obsidian Hourglass**: The spatial strategy.
*   **The Swarmlord of Webs**: The persona.
*   **The Organs**: Is `body/digestion` still the right place for the "Assimilator"?
*   **The Stigmergy**: Is NATS just "Plasma", or is it "Pheromones"?

## 3. Workshop Questions (For the Overmind)

1.  **Metaphor Alignment**: Should we blend the *Thermodynamics* (Cooling) with the *Biological* (Hardening/Chitin)?
    *   *Option A*: Keep pure Physics (Plasma -> Crystal).
    *   *Option B*: Hybridize (Pheromone -> Tissue -> Bone -> Obsidian).
2.  **The "Assimilator" Role**: Is this agent a "Cooling System" or a "Digestion Organ"?
3.  **The "Header Swarm"**: We built `header_swarm.py`. Is this the "Gas" phase (Clouds) or the "Tissue" phase (Soft Structure)?

## 4. Proposed Recalibration

We can re-frame the "Cooling System" as **"Biomineralization"** (The process by which living organisms produce minerals).

*   **Lvl 0 (Pheromone/Plasma)**: Ephemeral signals.
*   **Lvl 1 (Tissue/Gas)**: Soft, flexible structures (Markdown).
*   **Lvl 2 (Bone/Liquid)**: Dense, structural support (Vectors).
*   **Lvl 3 (Obsidian/Crystal)**: The hardest, sharpest truth (Graph).

This keeps the "Crystal" goal but grounds it in Biology.

## 5. Action Items

*   [ ] Review `brain/design_holonic_knowledge_leveling.md`.
*   [ ] Decide on the Metaphor (Physics vs. Biology vs. Hybrid).
*   [ ] Update `AGENTS.md` with the decision.
