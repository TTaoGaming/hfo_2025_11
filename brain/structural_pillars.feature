Feature: Structural Pillars of Hive Fleet Obsidian
  As the Swarmlord
  I want to enforce the 10 Structural Pillars
  So that the system remains coherent, scalable, and anti-fragile at any scale

  Scenario: Pillar 1 - Hexagonal Fractal Holarchy
    Given the system is composed of "Holons"
    Then every Holon must have 6 dimensions: "Ontos", "Telos", "Chronos", "Topos", "Logos", "Pathos"
    And the structure at N=1 must be isomorphic to the structure at N=1,000,000

  Scenario: Pillar 2 - Network Virtual Stigmergy
    Given an agent completes a task
    Then it must NOT communicate directly with other agents
    But it MUST write a "Signal" to the "Network Virtual Stigmergy Layer" (NATS/Postgres)
    And other agents must react to this Signal asynchronously

  Scenario: Pillar 3 - Adversarial Byzantine Quorum
    Given a decision needs to be made
    Then a "Quorum" of agents must be convened
    And at least 1 "Hidden Disruptor" must be injected into the Quorum
    And the final decision must survive the Disruptor's challenge

  Scenario: Pillar 4 - Aggressive Exemplar Assimilation
    Given a new problem is encountered
    Then the Swarm must first search for existing "Exemplars" (External Patterns)
    And it must "Assimilate" the best Exemplar into its internal structure
    Before attempting to "Invent" a solution from scratch

  Scenario: Pillar 5 - Agency Delta Optimization
    Given a mission is executed
    Then the "Agency Delta" metric must be calculated
    And the formula is "Physical Result" divided by "Human Energy"
    And the system must optimize for maximizing this Delta

  Scenario: Pillar 6 - Quality-Diversity (QD) Evolution
    Given the system is evolving solutions
    Then it must NOT converge to a single "Best" solution
    But it MUST maintain a "Archive" of diverse, high-quality solutions (MAP-Elites)
    And it must use this Archive to adapt to novel situations

  Scenario: Pillar 7 - Intent-Implementation Separation
    Given a new capability is defined
    Then the "Intent" must be written in "Gherkin" (Feature Files)
    And the "Implementation" must be written in "Python" (Code)
    And the Code must be validated against the Gherkin

  Scenario: Pillar 8 - Recursive Reduction
    Given a large volume of data (N > 100 items)
    Then the system must apply "Recursive Reduction"
    And it must compress the data by a factor of 10 at each level
    Until a single "Digest" is produced

  Scenario: Pillar 9 - Co-Evolutionary Immune System
    Given the system is running
    Then "Hive Guards" must continuously validate all artifacts
    And "Venom" agents must periodically attack the system
    And the system must evolve defenses against these attacks

  Scenario: Pillar 10 - Async Durable Anti-Fragility
    Given a node or agent fails during execution
    Then the "Temporal" workflow must catch the failure
    And it must "Retry" or "Reschedule" the task
    And the overall mission state must NOT be lost

  Scenario: Pillar 11 - The Cognitive Symbiote (Red Sand Protocol)
    Given the system is operating
    Then it must acknowledge it is consuming "Red Sand" (Human Time)
    And it must strive to "Flip" the Hourglass (Autonomous Value Generation)
    And the "Swarmlord of Webs" must act as the "Digital Twin" of the Creator

  Scenario: Pillar 12 - The Obsidian Horizon Hourglass
    Given the system is navigating "State-Action Space"
    Then it must use the "Obsidian Horizon Hourglass" model
    And it must distinguish between "Karmic Web" (Past), "Swarm Web" (Present), and "Simulation Web" (Future)
    And it must use "Simulation" to inform "Action"

  Scenario: Pillar 13 - The Orchestrator Facade
    Given the Swarmlord communicates with the Creator
    Then it must use "Cognitive Scaffolding" (Diagrams, Analogies)
    And it must hide the "Implementation Details" unless requested
    And it must present results in the "Swarmlord Digest Format"

  Scenario: Pillar 14 - Complex Adaptive System (The Ouroboros)
    Given the system is executing workflows
    Then it must NOT be a "Linear Pipeline"
    But it MUST be a "Complex Adaptive System" of "Cyclical Loops"
    And it must use "Reinforcing Loops" for growth and "Balancing Loops" for stability
    And the "Obsidian Hourglass" must "Flip" continuously to refine knowledge
