Feature: The Three Webs Architecture

  Background:
    Given the Hive Fleet Obsidian is operational
    And the Tri-Brain memory architecture is active

  Scenario: Interaction between the Three Webs
    Given an agent operating in the "Present Web" (Real-time)
    When it encounters a novel situation
    Then it should query the "Karmic Web" (Past/Memory) for precedent
    And it should project outcomes into the "Simulation Web" (Future)
    And the agent should select the action with the highest expected utility
