Feature: Hypercasual Gesture HCI Game Forge
  As the Swarmlord
  I want to create a factory for simple, gesture-controlled games
  So that I can achieve high income, validate tool virtualization, and liberate beings from scarcity.

  Scenario: Forge Initialization
    Given the "Gesture Engine" (MediaPipe/Human) is tuned for <50ms latency
    And a library of "Open Source Games" (PyGame/JS) is available for reskinning
    When the "Forge Swarm" is activated
    Then it should "Evolve" control schemes using genetic algorithms
    And it should "Reskin" games to match the gesture mechanics
    And it should "Deploy" prototypes to the "Hypercasual Market"
    And the system should measure "Retention" and "Skill Transfer".
