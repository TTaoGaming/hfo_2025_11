Feature: Pheromone Composability and Antifragility
  As the Swarmlord
  I want a multi-layered Stigmergy system (YAML, NATS, Vector)
  So that the Hive is antifragile, composable, and self-organizing

  Scenario: Multi-Layered Signal Propagation
    Given an agent generates an artifact
    When the artifact is saved with a "YAML Stigmergy Header"
    And a "Hot Pheromone" is emitted to NATS JetStream
    And the content is embedded into "Cold Memory" (Vector DB)
    Then the system possesses three layers of redundancy and accessibility

  Scenario: Antifragile Response to Stress
    Given the Hive is under high load or attack (Disruptor)
    When the "Pheromone Density" in NATS exceeds a threshold
    Then the "Immunizer Guard" tightens validation rules automatically
    And "Stem Cells" are triggered to spawn specialized agents
    Resulting in a stronger system post-stress

  Scenario: Composable Pheromones
    Given multiple agents emitting different pheromone types (e.g., "Food", "Danger")
    When these signals overlap in the Stigmergy Layer
    Then a "Composite Signal" (e.g., "Safe Food") emerges
    Allowing complex behavior to arise from simple signals
