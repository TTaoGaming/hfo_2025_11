Feature: Biomimetic Organ Registry
  As the Taxonomist
  I want to map the Hive's anatomy to biological organs
  So that the system feels like a living organism.

  Scenario: Organ Mapping
    Given the directory structure
    Then the following mappings must be enforced:
      | Directory | Biological Name | Function |
      | brain/    | Cortex          | Strategy & Intent |
      | eyes/     | Ocelli          | Sensing & Ingestion |
      | body/     | Soma            | Execution Platform |
      | nerves/   | Ganglia         | Coordination |
      | hands/    | Mandibles       | Tools & Action |
      | blood/    | Hemolymph       | Resource Transport |
      | carapace/ | Carapace        | Defense & Validation |
      | venom/    | Lysosomes       | Digestion & Testing |
      | memory/   | Mycelium        | Knowledge Network |
