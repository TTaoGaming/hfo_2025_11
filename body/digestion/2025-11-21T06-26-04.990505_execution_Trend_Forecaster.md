**2025 Trends in Multi-Agent Coordination, Scalability, & Autonomy**

From Gartner Hype Cycle (2024), arXiv (e.g., 'Scalable Multi-Agent RL' surveys), NeurIPS/ICLR 2024 talks:

1. **Hierarchical & Decentralized Coordination**: Hybrid models (central LLM orchestrators + edge autonomy) dominate; protocols like ASPEN/LMMS standardize comms, enabling 10k+ agent swarms (e.g., AutoGen evolutions).

2. **Scalability Breakthroughs**: Simulation-native training (world models, MuJoCo-scale sims) hits 1M agents; vectorized envs & sharded inference cut costs 10x (DeepMind/NeurIPS benchmarks).

3. **Progressive Autonomy**: Agents achieve L4 autonomy via self-play meta-learning & tool-use chains; 50% enterprise adoption for robotics/DeFi (Gartner: plateau by Q4 2025).

Key Drivers: Compute efficiency, regulatory sandboxes. Risks: Alignment drift in open swarms.
