## 🧬 Biological Function
The **Body** is the engine of **Execution**. It turns the Brain's intent into reality. It is composed of three specialized systems:
1.  **Nerves (`body/nerves`)**: Communication and routing (The Bridger).
2.  **Hands (`body/hands`)**: Tool use and code generation (The Shaper).
3.  **Blood (`body/blood`)**: Logistics and resource injection (The Injector).

## 📂 Contents
*   `nerves/`: Signal routing and message passing.
*   `hands/`: Tools, SDKs, and active agents.
*   `blood/`: Setup scripts, dependency management, and infrastructure.
*   `models/`: Pydantic data models (The DNA).

## 🤖 Agent Instructions
*   **Action**: This is where work happens.
*   **Coordination**: Use `nerves` to talk to other agents.
