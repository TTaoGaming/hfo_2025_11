# Gen 33: The Canonization (Formal MBSE)

**Created**: 2025-11-18
**Status**: Active Generation (Restored)
**Focus**: Formalizing the "Rich Context" of Gen 33 into a SysML v2 Canon.

---

## The Mission
We are taking the "Rich Context Archives" (the messy but valuable reality of HFO) and distilling them into a **Formal SysML v2 Model**. This is not about inventing new things (Gen 34), but about **locking in** what we already have in Gen 33.

## The Sections (Priority Order)

### 1. Ground Truths (The Axioms)
*Defining the non-negotiables.*
- **L0** = 1 Agent (Atomic).
- **Scaling** = Log10.
- **Topology** = Mesh (Stigmergy).
- **Defense** = Fractal Immunity.

### 2. The Holon (Structure)
*Defining the unit.*
- `Mosaic_Tile` definition.
- `L0_Atomic_Holon` definition.

### 3. The Mesh (Connection)
*Defining the glue.*
- NATS JetStream Protocol.
- Signal Types (Heartbeat, Confidence, Citation).

### 4. The Emergence (Capabilities)
*Defining what happens at scale.*
- L1 Consensus.
- L2 Orchestration.
- L3 Strategy (Hourglass).

## The Artifacts
- `sysml/HFO_CANON.sysml`: The master definition file.
- `sysml/STIGMERGY_PROTOCOL.sysml`: The communication standard.
