# User Terminology Guide - Exact Quotes & Nuances

**Created**: 2025-11-17
**Purpose**: Preserve user's exact terminology and philosophical nuances for Gen 33

---

## Core Philosophy

> "This is a composition and evolutionary system. There is NO INVENTIONS. If there's anything without a clear provenance or battle-tested evidence, we don't use it. We only use the best and the ones that have proven themselves."

**Key Principle**: Standing on shoulders of giants - **NO INVENTION**, only composition of battle-tested patterns

## 4 Fractal HOLONIC Workflows

### Critical Properties

**Direct Quote**:
> "Four fractal, HOLONIC patterns that are closed loops at four different time horizons that bidirectionally feedback."

**Properties**:
- **Cyclical**: Closed loops, not linear progressions
- **HOLONIC**: Each level is whole (operates independently) + part (nested within larger loop)
- **Bidirectional**: Emergence flows UP (bottom-up), constraints flow DOWN (top-down)
- **Time-horizoned**: Different speeds at each level
- **Grounded**: All patterns map to battle-tested lineage

### Loop-to-Level Mapping (CRITICAL)

**Direct Quote**:
> "Some run 24/7 some are mission specific, it is the workflow cycle for each agent, everyone runs it. PREY is execution level SWARM is tactical. Actually we can tie it into the levels. lvl0 is PREY, lvl1 (lvl 1 = 10 agents) is SWARM (+previous), lvl3 is GROWTH and lvl4 is HIVE and each later level will have to introduce a fractal holonic pattern to integrate for the level up"

**Fractal Holonic Integration Pattern**:
- **L0 (1 agent)**: PREY only
- **L1 (10 agents)**: SWARM + PREY (adds tactical coordination)
- **L2 (100 agents)**: GROWTH + SWARM + PREY (adds strategic orchestration)
- **L3 (1000 agents)**: HIVE + GROWTH + SWARM + PREY (adds vision evolution)

**Key Insights**:
- **Workflow cycle per agent**: Every agent runs their level's workflow cycle
- **24/7 vs mission-specific**: Some workflows run continuously, some are task-bound
- **Additive composition**: Each level ADDS a new holonic pattern (not replacements)
- **PREY is universal**: Runs at EVERY level - it's the execution substrate
- **Fractal integration**: "Each later level will have to introduce a fractal holonic pattern to integrate for the level up"

---

## PREY Loop (Execution Level)

### Exact Quotes

**Nature**:
> "At the execution level, which is the lowest level and the fastest level, there is no specific time frame. It could be as fast as compute. It could be as slow as whatever long it takes for an agent to do something."

**Cyclical Property**:
> "It is a cyclical loop. It is the same as OODA. It is based off of JADC2 Sense-Make Sense-Act loop with a feedback built in, which is the yield step. It is mapping almost directly to MAPE-K as well."

**Speed**:
> "Again, it's a cyclical fast loop where any agent can just perceive, react, execute, and then yield. And it just goes in a cycle. The idea is that each agent should go through this loop super fast, like very, very rapidly, where it's constantly perceiving, reacting, acting, and then yielding something or giving feedback up or to the side in the virtual stigmergy."

### Battle-Tested Lineage

- **OODA** (Boyd 1976): Observe → Orient → Decide → Act
- **JADC2** (DoD): Joint All-Domain Command & Control - Sense → Make Sense → Act
- **MAPE-K** (IBM): Monitor → Analyze → Plan → Execute + Knowledge

### Key Characteristics

- **Time Horizon**: "As fast as compute" (milliseconds to minutes, depends on workload)
- **Trust Model**: N/A (single agent, no quorum needed)
- **Disruptor**: NO (single agent level, no adversarial pressure)
- **Cyclical**: Continuous until goal achieved

---

## SWARM Loop (Tactical Level)

### Exact Quotes

**Byzantine Trust Philosophy**:
> "The idea is NOT to trust a swarm, it's to use a Byzantine swarm so that we have a supervisor that we can trust a little bit more."

**D3A + Mutate**:
> "The next level is the tactical level. It is the SWARM mnemonic which is based off of D3A plus specific mutation step."

**Execution Flow**:
> "It goes through, it sets the intention, sets everything up, it watches to make sure everything's OK, then it acts using the swarm most likely using some kind of scatter and gather pattern, and then it reviews all the information and then it mutates it to improve it as well. Again, it's cyclical, it should go pretty fast. This one is more of a tactical level. So it could be, you know, on each individual run or a cohort of runs or it could even be a little longer than that as well. But it's more focused on the tactical."

### 90% Max Confidence Rule

**Direct Quote**:
> "In a swarm of 10, we should always have at the minimum one disruptor. So the user and the system's confidence level should max out at 90% at level one HFO, because one out of ten should absolutely be a red team."

**Why Byzantine**:
> "The system is built for Byzantine, and the idea is, you know, we'll prove it. If the disruptor is sneaking through, that's a good thing to know, and the idea is to simulate attackers before we get real attacks. But honestly, right now, using AI agents and assistants, the whole system is Byzantine because there's so much reward hacking, hallucinations and other things. I could barely trust my system. Now it's working, but I need Byzantine quorum for sure."

### Disruptor (Red Team) Role

**Direct Quote**:
> "At every step of the way, maybe except for the PREY loop, so the moment we get to the swarm loop, there should always be a Disruptor mixed in so that the system - we're not just guessing that something's gonna go wrong. No, we are going to have an agent absolutely prove to us that the system is insecure."

**Attack Vectors**:
> "The disruptor should be able to see everything and find a vector of attack using something like ATT&CK playbook or other attack vectors."

### Adversarial Co-Evolution

**Direct Quote**:
> "It should go through evolutionary loop with the blue team which is my immunizer role, which is my static hive guards, my active hive guards, pre-commit hive guards etcetera. It is my entire immune system and the idea is that the red team and blue team will constantly evolutionary co-evolve each other using adversarial pressure."

### Battle-Tested Lineage

- **D3A** (Distributed Decision-Making) + Mutate
- **CP-WBFT** (Consistent Partition Byzantine Fault Tolerance)
- **MAP-Elites** (Mouret 2015) - Quality Diversity optimization

### Key Characteristics

- **Time Horizon**: Minutes to cohorts of runs
- **Trust Model**: **Byzantine** (90% max confidence at L1 with 1/10 Disruptor)
- **Disruptor**: **MANDATORY** (≥1 red team in every swarm of 10+)
- **Mnemonic**: Set → Watch → Act → Review → Mutate (D3A + Mutate)

---

## GROWTH Loop (Strategic Level)

### Exact Quotes

**Status**:
> "The GROWTH step is not fully visualized in my mind. It's not crystal clear yet. It's actually the weakest part of these 4-step process, the four holonic workflows."

**Lineage**:
> "On the strategic level, it is called GROWTH, which stands for Gather, Root, Optimize, Weave-test, Harvest and it is based off of F3EAD and it should map almost one to one directly. The idea is that we're using existing research and battle-tested patterns. These are just my mutations of them for Hive Fleet Obsidian, but they're grounded in the lineage of battle tested patterns."

**Focus**:
> "The GROWTH should really be focused on the strategic layer of the swarm."

### Battle-Tested Lineage

- **F3EAD** (military): Find → Fix → Finish → Exploit → Analyze → Disseminate (ops tempo cycle)

### Key Characteristics

- **Time Horizon**: Hours to days
- **Trust Model**: Byzantine + human oversight
- **Disruptor**: YES (cross-round validation, gap identification)
- **Status**: ⚠️ **WEAKEST LINK** - Not fully formalized yet
- **Mnemonic**: Gather → Root → Optimize → Weave-test → Harvest

---

## HIVE Loop (Vision Level)

### Exact Quotes

**Philosophy**:
> "This is a composition and evolutionary system. There is no inventions. If there's anything without a clear provenance or battle tested evidence like we don't use it like we only use the best and the ones that are proven themselves."

**Hunt (APEX Discovery)**:
> "It hunts for the apex and that could be across any domain. It could be with any tool, it could be any industry exemplar, any biomimetic apex patterns, pretty much any state of the art that is being used, any research papers. It doesn't matter. It's hunting."

**Integrate (Sandboxed)**:
> "And then it integrates into HFO. And what that means is for the integration step, it needs to be sandboxed. We cannot just randomly integrate things. Instead, what needs to happen is a clear full step, which is we're using that already, which is like a Byzantine integration pattern."

**Validate (V&V)**:
> "And then once we integrate it and we smoke test it, we make sure it works, then what we're gonna do next is to validate and that could be with static test and active tests. But honestly, it could be like verification, validation, all of it. It's gonna be like, we need to make sure that yes, we hunted, yes, it's integrated, but are we sure it works? Like we need to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that it works."

**Evolve (Quality Diversity)**:
> "And then we're going to evolve it. For evolution, that means no matter what the state of the art is, we should be able to get MAP-Elites quality diversity. We should be the best in the niche that we're in based on mission constraints. I don't need to beat state of the art, I just need to mutate it."

### Battle-Tested Lineage

- **Double Diamond** (design thinking): Discover → Define → Develop → Deliver
- **CBR** (Case-Based Reasoning): Retrieve → Reuse → Revise → Retain
- **Syn** (Synthesis): Composition and integration

### Key Characteristics

- **Time Horizon**: Days to weeks
- **Trust Model**: Human + Byzantine (sandbox required, no direct production changes)
- **Disruptor**: MANDATORY ("should be able to see everything and find a vector of attack using ATT&CK playbook")
- **Mnemonic**: Hunt → Integrate → Validate → Evolve
- **Quality Strategy**: "I don't need to beat SOTA, I just need to mutate it" - MAP-Elites quality diversity

## Disruptor (Red Team) - Mandatory at SWARM+

### Exact Quotes

**When to Use**:
> "One of my major roles that isn't being fully online right now is the Disruptor Red team. So essentially at every step of the way, maybe except for the PREY loop. So the moment we get to the swarm loop, there should always be a Disruptor mixed in."

**Purpose**:
> "We're not just guessing that something's gonna go wrong. No, we are going to have an agent, absolutely prove to us that the system is insecure and that we're gonna have a defense in depth because it can access the code base."

**Minimum Requirement**:
> "In a swarm of 10 for example, we should always have at the minimum one disruptor."

**Max Confidence**:
> "The user and the system's confidence level should max out at 90% at level one HFO, because one out of ten should absolutely be a red team."

**Attack Framework**:
> "The disruptor should be able to see everything and find a vector of attack using something like ATT&CK playbook or other attack vectors."

**Why It Matters**:
> "The idea is to simulate attackers before we get real attacks. But honestly, right now, using AI agents and assistants like the whole system is Byzantine because there's so much reward hacking, hallucinations and other things."

## Immunizer (Blue Team) - Defense in Depth

### Exact Quotes

**Comprehensive Defense**:
> "It should go through evolutionary loop with the blue team which is my immunizer role, which is my static hive guards, my active hive guards, pre-commit hive guards etcetera. It is my entire immune system."

**Adversarial Co-Evolution**:
> "The idea is that the red team and blue team will constantly evolutionary co-evolve each other using adversarial pressure."

### Components

- **Static Hive Guards**: Pre-commit validation, linting, type checking (can't hallucinate - pure Python)
- **Active Hive Guards**: Runtime validation, circuit breakers, health monitoring
- **Pre-commit Guards**: Git hooks blocking bad commits
- **Entire Immune System**: Defense-in-depth across all layers

---

## HFO System Architecture Quote

### Complete Vision

**Direct Quote**:
> "HFO is built for a Byzantine adversarial co-evolution APEX swarm."

**What This Means**:
- **Byzantine**: Untrusted agents require quorum consensus (90% max confidence with Disruptor)
- **Adversarial Co-Evolution**: Red team (Disruptor) vs Blue team (Immunizer) constantly pressuring each other
- **APEX**: Hunts for best-in-class patterns across all domains (academic, industry, biomimetic, military)
- **Swarm**: Multi-agent coordination at scale (L0=1, L1=10, L2=100, L3=1000)

## Critical Nuances to Preserve

### 1. Time Horizons are NOT Fixed

**PREY**: "No specific time frame. Could be as fast as compute. Could be as slow as whatever long it takes for an agent."

**Implication**: Don't hardcode timeouts - depends on workload

### 2. GROWTH is Incomplete

**Direct Quote**: "Not fully visualized yet. Not crystal clear. Weakest part of the 4-step process."

**Implication**: Document as provisional, expect iteration

### 3. Byzantine is Not Optional

**Direct Quote**: "I could barely trust my system. Now it's working, but I need Byzantine quorum for sure."

**Implication**: All multi-agent coordination requires Byzantine consensus

### 4. 90% Max Confidence is By Design

**Direct Quote**: "User and system confidence should max out at 90% at L1 because one out of ten should absolutely be red team."

**Implication**: Not a limitation - it's adversarial co-evolution working as intended

### 5. Sandboxing is Mandatory for Integration

**Direct Quote**: "We cannot just randomly integrate things."

**Implication**: HIVE Integrate step requires isolation, no direct production access

### 6. Quality Diversity > SOTA Chasing

**Direct Quote**: "I don't need to beat state of the art, I just need to mutate it."

**Implication**: MAP-Elites best-in-niche strategy, not benchmark-chasing

### 7. WHOLE = HFO Authority, Not Human Authority

**Direct Quote**: "It shouldnt need a human but it should require a authority within HFO so a Navigator like swarmlord of webs. later it will be broken into categories that can be automated with nats jetstream virtual stigmergy layer, so low risk tasks might be automated but higher risk needs to be gated by the Immunizers and if really important it should go to a navigator."

**Authorization Hierarchy**:
- **Low Risk**: Automated via NATS JetStream virtual stigmergy layer
- **Medium Risk**: Gated by Immunizers (blue team validation)
- **High Risk**: Escalates to Navigator (Swarmlord of Webs authority)

**Implication**: Holons are autonomous (no human needed), but require HFO internal authority (Navigator role)

### 8. Mutate = Evolutionary Search to BEAT SOTA

**Direct Quote**: "Mutate means using evolutionary algorithms to discover MAP ELITE that should be able to beat SOTA under certain constraints."

**What Mutation Actually Means**:
- NOT just adaptation or niche specialization
- YES evolutionary algorithms to actively OUTPERFORM SOTA
- Under specific constraints (cost, latency, accuracy trade-offs)
- MAP-Elites quality-diversity: Find best solution per behavioral niche
- Goal: Beat SOTA in constrained niches via evolutionary search

**Implication**: HIVE Evolve step runs genetic algorithms, hyperparameter optimization, evolutionary search over compositions - aiming to discover configurations that beat SOTA given mission constraints
