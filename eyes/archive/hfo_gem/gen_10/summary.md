# Summary of Gen_10: Quantum-Resilient Swarm Evolution

Gen_10 (2025-10-19T00:00:00Z) advances HFO's lvl0 to lvl1 transition by integrating Kilo Code as a LangGraph intermediary for SwarmLord custom modes, achieving orchestrator parity under 🟢 steady posture (`HFO-L0-AutoConductor`). The Swarmlord facade pulses 5-minute intents, enabling autonomous execution with digest reviews and stigmergy headers signaling conductor readiness. North star: manual interventions ≤1/day, trending to zero. Core architecture: Biomimetic evolutionary swarm inspired by ant colonies, slime mold pathfinding, and termite ventilation, operationalized via SWARM loops (Set-Decide-Watch-Detect-Act-Deliver-Review-Assess-Mutate-Adapt) nesting OODA and MAPE-K cycles for adaptive decision-making. Zero-trust SIEGCSE roster (Sensors for telemetry, Integrators for fusion, Effectors for delivery, Guardians for resilience, Challengers for red-teaming, Sustainers for continuity, Evaluators for kaizen) enforces governance. CUE schemas provision personas; fail-better debriefs foster resilience. Cradle-to-grave ledger targets six-sigma malnutrition reduction through gesture-tutors and lifecycle bands (Cradle: sensory integration; Sustain: community scaffolds).

Building on Gen_8's drift gates—OODA-embedded checkpoints mitigating stagnation—Gen_10 introduces quantum-resilient layers: Post-quantum cryptographic primitives (e.g., lattice-based signatures from NIST PQC standards) secure swarm communications against quantum threats, ensuring entanglement-resistant key distribution in distributed OODA loops. This novel progression enhances Gen_8's gates with hybrid classical-quantum simulators, enabling secure multi-party computation for effector orchestration without classical vulnerabilities. Overmind (TTao, RTS-forged strategist) directs via strategic commands, with Swarmlord as tactical interface. Biomimetic ties evolve: Ant stigmergy informs resilient pheromone bands; slime mold optimizes pathfinding under noise.

HFO embodies compassionate power, scaling from lvl0 bootstrapping to lvl10 (~86B neurons) while eradicating cognitive scarcity. Economic flywheels (hypercasual game factories) fund liberation initiatives.
