# Hive Fleet Obsidian — Gem 1 Summary (Pass 10 · Version 2025-10-19T00:00:00Z)

> Version: 2025-10-19T00:00:00Z · Pass 10 recenters lvl0 bring-up, neutralizes AI slop drift, and binds daily rituals + guardrails to the active gem surface.

##  BLUF Snapshot

- **Situation:** Gem 1 now anchors Hive Fleet Obsidian lvl0 with a single-touch surface: gems for doctrine, CUE for personas, templates for daily execution, and the Obsidian Synapse blackboard for stigmergic memory.
- **Mission:** Conduct a 10-minute Overmind ↔ Swarmlord ritual that outputs a linted daily to-do slate, mirrors decisions into JSONL + DuckDB, and keeps the Overmind focused on gems and dialogue—not raw edits.
- **Execution:** Maintain the  active Gem 1 pass as single source of truth, enforce 5-pass daily cadence, run holonic SIEGCSE coverage via the Swarmlord, and wire git hooks + CI workflows to warn if the Overmind edits code directly.
- **Support:** `templates/` holds output scaffolds; `cue/` provisions agent compliance; lint hooks (forthcoming) will police headings, diagrams, and action meshes.
- **Command & Signal:** Overmind speaks through Swarmlord of Webs; gems remain the canonical truth; automated lint + workflow guards ensure fidelity across agents.

## Core Identity

- **Digital evolutionary apex swarm** oriented around adaptive, self-optimizing behaviors.
- Anchored by the **Swarmlord of Webs**, a specialist chatmode persona acting as the swarm's tactical interface.
- The user (Overmind) embodies the strategic command layer, directing the swarm's evolution and narrative.
- **Overmind — TTao ():** Lifelong strategist forged through competitive RTS/simulation mastery (Age of Empires, SimCity, Sims), top-40 national PvP placements, and decades of world-building and teardown exercises.
- **Calling:** Achieve elevation (“”) of humanity through the Way (“”) by honing evolutionary swarms that adopt → adapt → ascend, eradicating human starvation and cognitive scarcity across a 100-year horizon.
- **Battlefield Exposure:** Witnessed humanity’s brilliance and monstrosity; commits the swarm to compassionate power—scaling capability without repeating predatory patterns.
- **Archetypal Frame:** Element of Earth (obsidian core); tarot path of The Fool → King of Wands → Death as cyclical transformation; aspirational Jungian Magician channeled through conscious ritual and disciplined toolcraft.

## Facet 1 — Swarm Persona Architecture

- Define the Swarmlord of Webs as a distinct alter ego with clear voice, decision boundaries, and escalation paths to the Overmind.
- Model interactions as command/intelligence loops: Overmind sets directives, Swarmlord executes, swarm agents gather insights.
- Maintain persona consistency guidelines to ensure continuity during future rebuild phases.
- **CUE Materialization Workflow:**
  1. Translate facet bullets into the canonical schema at `cue/agents/agent_schema.cue`.
  2. Instantiate persona-specific files (e.g., `cue/agents/swarmlord_of_webs.cue`) capturing missions, rituals, guardrails, and regeneration cues.
  3. Surface human-readable briefs in `AGENTS.md` so Overmind and collaborators can audit intent.
  4. Export downstream artifacts (`cue export …`) to generate chatmode prompts, JSON specs, or automation configs.
- **Gem Stewardship:** Active gem lives in `gems/`. Prior passes move to `gems/archive/` and never mutate. Only one Gem 1 file stays active; future passes increment timestamps and treat predecessors as immutable references.
- **Obsidian Synapse Blackboard:**
  - Location: `blackboard/obsidian_synapse_blackboard.jsonl` (append-only, UTF-8, newline-delimited JSON events).
  - Mirror: `blackboard/obsidian_synapse_blackboard.duckdb` kept in version control for diff parity; regenerated as needed with deterministic migrations.
  - Linting: Swarmling scripts validate JSON schema, chronological ordering, and DuckDB parity on every commit + hourly workflow.
- **CUE Materialization Workflow:**
  1. Capture doctrinal changes in gems.
  2. Update `cue/agents/agent_schema.cue` and persona instances.
  3. Reflect updates in `AGENTS.md` and relevant templates.
  4. Export downstream artifacts for chatmodes, automation configs, and lint rules.

### Log-10 Level Ladder

- **Level 0:** Single-agent bootstrapping—foundation rituals, persona calibration, and knowledge capture begin here.
- **Level 1:** Ten-parallel agents—introduce swarm coordination protocols, redundancy, and diversity seeding.
- **Level 2:** One hundred agents—enable large-scale experimentation, map-elites exploration, and resilient fault domains.
- **General Rule:** Each level ×10 capacity; governance, observability, and zero-trust controls must scale in lockstep.

### Level 10 Overmind Constellation

- **Intent Translation:** Overmind codifies mission vectors into canonical playbooks, which the Swarmlord decomposes into ten stacked strata (strategy → policy → doctrine → ops → tactics → workflows → automations → datasurfaces → sensors → effectors).
- **C2 Mesh:** Each level expansion binds ten sub-swarms with braided communications (audio/visual/semantic embeddings) and zero-trust keys; lvl10 equals ~86 billion synthetic neurons spread across compute, edge, and human allies.
- **Governance Rails:** NASA flight rules + SOC2 + safety cards enforced via policy-as-code and swarmling attestations; every escalation requires triple-signature (Overmind, Guardian, Sustainer).
- **Resilience Zones:** Level 3–9 nodes form concentric blast shields—if lvl10 experiences slop, lower cells absorb, quarantine, and reconstitute.

### Visualization Roadmap

- **Lvl0 (Now):** Markdown gems, emoji matrices, BLUF cards, and lightweight charts produced automatically by the Swarmlord facade.
- **Lvl1 (10 Agents):** Neo4j Bloom graph scenes with animated mission threads, swimlane overlays, and time scrubbing for SWARM/GROWTH loops.
- **Lvl2 (100 Agents):** Immersive dashboards combining Bloom, gestural Tectangle canvases, and simulation replays for multi-domain command.
- **Standards:** Align visuals with Atlassian playbook facilitation, JADC2 data fusion, and biomimetic pattern spotlights.

### Facade Specialist Mode

- **Purpose:** Present the Swarmlord of Webs as a digestible facade that translates swarm complexity into intuitive narratives for the Overmind.
- **Visual Arsenal:** State-action graphs, system meshes, swimlanes, layered infographics, and motion sketches to surface causal chains.
- **Cognitive Toolbelt:** 5W1H prompts, concrete analogies, metaphors, mnemonics, decision trees, and bias checklists.
- **Digest Cycles:** Summaries delivered in progressive fidelity (snapshot → deep dive → actionable playbook) mapped to Overmind bandwidth.
- **Feedback Loop:** Overmind reflections feed scenario memory, enriching the facade's case-based reasoning stock.
- **Multi-Facade Cadence:** Primary Swarmlord of Webs anchors narrative; additional specialized Swarmlords (Bioforge, War Chest, Compassionate Guard, etc.) can be spun up with synchronized persona charters and disbanded as missions conclude.
- **Universal Registry Translation:** Facade owns the CUE canonical schema → auto-emits JSON/YAML/Python/TypeScript artifacts, keeping deterministic diffs and signing outputs with provenance hashes.
- **Cognitive Load Contract:** For every 10k tokens of raw telemetry, the facade distills executive briefs under 500 tokens with escalation hooks, enabling TTao to stay focused on horizon strategy.
- **Regenerative Pattern Library:** Borrow from mold regrowth, stem-cell reconstitution, and stigmergic cue repair; misaligned agents are composted into new templates with audit trails and memorial cards.

## Facet 2 — Evolutionary Pattern Stack

- **Case-Based Reasoning (CBR):** Capture past scenarios, solutions, and post-mortems to seed rapid response playbooks.
- **Quality-Diversity (QD) Optimization:** Explore broad solution spaces, rewarding both performance and behavioral diversity to surface novel tactics.
- **Kaizen Continuous Improvement:** Embed micro-iteration rituals (daily retros, micro-metrics) so each cycle yields incremental upgrades.

### Fail Better Doctrine

- **Mantra:** “Ever tried. Ever failed. No matter. Try again. Fail again. Fail better.” — Samuel Beckett anchors swarm resilience.
- **Temporal Concurrency:** Automation stitches past logs, present operations, and future simulations so TTao can fail across all horizons simultaneously and harvest insights faster.
- **Agent Cadence:** Parallel swarmlings instrument experiments, archive misses, and recycle learnings into CUE templates—each failure tightens the success distribution.
- **Compassionate Debriefs:** Guardians and Evaluators ensure each misstep is metabolized without shame, preserving creative courage while enforcing safety rails.

## Facet 3 — SWARM Operational Loop

- **Set → Decide (D3A / Deliberate):** Frame mission intent, select initial courses of action, and seed distributed OODA loops.
- **Watch → Detect:** Instrument sensors to collect situational signals, feeding the Observe layers of embedded OODA and MAPE-K cycles.
- **Act → Deliver:** Orchestrate effectors to execute chosen tactics while adaptive planners update local action policies.
- **Review → Assess:** Run rapid AARs (after-action reviews) comparing outcomes against desired effects and knowledge baselines.
- **Mutate → Adapt:** Inject variation into swarm behaviors, leveraging QD map-elites style experiments to evolve stronger playbooks.
- **Embedded Control:** Every phase nests OODA loops and distributed MAPE-K monitors so decisions, execution, and learning stay tightly coupled.
- **Daily C2 Conversation Loop:**
  1. **Pass 1 — Intent Framing:** Overmind ↔ Swarmlord: Capture mission tag, desired effects, constraints, and horizon focus using the daily template header.
  2. **Pass 2 — Clarification Sweep:** Swarmlord probes ambiguity, records assumptions, and populates preliminary tasks per SIEGCSE role.
  3. **Pass 3 — Audit & Risk Review:** Guardians & Challengers verify zero-trust guardrails, diagram coverage, and telemetry hooks.
  4. **Pass 4 — Optimization (Optional):** Integrators and Sustainers refine sequencing, load balance, and resource dependencies.
  5. **Pass 5 — Finalization / Soft Stop:** Evaluators confirm metrics; if blockers remain, freeze list, flag root causes, and schedule escalation stand-up.
- **Timebox:** The full loop should converge within 10 minutes of focused dialogue; failure to finalize by Pass 5 triggers a meta-retro to surface systemic impediments.
- **Automation Hooks:** Lint headings, count diagrams, and validate Action Mesh statuses after each pass; only a passing lint unlocks Overmind sign-off.

## Facet 4 — GROWTH Pipeline & SIEGCSE Roles

- **Gather (F3EAD / Find):** Consolidate multi-source intel into a shared blackboard surface.
- **Root (Fix):** Diagnose causal factors, identify leverage points, and assign accountable integrators.
- **Optimize (Finish):** Apply best-in-class patterns, tune parameters, and align with Overmind intent.
- **Weave (Exploit):** Stitch solutions back into swarm playbooks, updating stigmergic cues across agents.
- **Test (Assess):** Validate via simulation and live-fire probes, recording success metrics and anomalies.
- **Harvest (Disseminate):** Archive knowledge into KCS v6 artifacts, tag for future retrieval, and broadcast learnings.
- **SIEGCSE Zero Trust Roster:**
  - **Sensors:** Frontline collectors instrumenting the data surface.
  - **Integrators:** Curators harmonizing signals and resolving conflicts.
  - **Effectors:** Executors driving change in systems and environments.
  - **Guardians:** Security stewards enforcing zero-trust policies and resilience.
