 🥇 SINGLETON: This is THE active GEM Gene Seed (only 1 should exist)
  Version: Pass 11 — 2025-10-20T00:00:00Z
  Regenerates: CUE schemas → AGENTS.md → Scripts → Tests → Docs
 ⏳ Red Sand: Every line costs TTao's finite lifespan → Keep signal high
  Mission: Kids helped = f(Revenue, Cost, Lifespan) — Health IS leverage



                              QUICK NAVIGATION INDEX

                          AI ASSISTANT RULES (READ FIRST)

 1.  ALWAYS UPDATE GEM FIRST → Then regenerate downstream
    (Never create code/scripts/tests without updating this GEM)

 2.  QUERY BLACKBOARD before status claims (Layer 9: Stigmergy)
    (ps aux, git log, ls to verify — Never say "done " without proof)

 3.  RUN POST-SUMMARY GATE after every conversation summarization
    (scripts/post_summary_gate.py — Catches 40% hallucination spike)

 4.  FORBIDDEN SIEGCSE ROLES (AI Slop — NEVER use these):
     Scouters, Innovators, Explorers, Supporters, Evolvers
     USE ONLY: Sensors, Integrators, Effectors, Guardians,
                 Challengers, Sustainers, Evaluators

 5.  HIVE WORKFLOW (No inventing — HUNT precedents first):
    • HUNT: Search CBR (case-based reasoning) for battle-tested patterns
    • INTEGRATE: Adopt industry exemplars (MITRE, JADC2, Cynefin, etc)
    • VERIFY: Test with real combat scenarios (PettingZoo, empirical data)
    • EVOLVE: Only after stabilization (never evolve during hallucinations)

 6.  80/20 PARETO: Catch 80% of issues with 20% effort (3 passes max)
    (Don't over-engineer — "Good enough" beats "perfect never ships")

 7.  METRICS OVER FEELINGS: V > H (Verification > Hallucination rate)
    (If no independent test, assume hallucination until proven otherwise)

 8.  REGENERATION SEQUENCE (Single Touch Surface):
    GEM (this file) → CUE schemas → AGENTS.md → Scripts → Tests → Docs
    (Only human touches GEM, everything else is auto-generated)

## What Is GEM GENE SEED 01?

This is the **complete instruction set** for building Hive Fleet Obsidian from first principles. Give this document to any LLM in any IDE and it can generate all code, playbooks, and infrastructure to build HFO at whatever level your resources support.

**Key Innovation:** Work **UPSTREAM** (Vision/Strategy in this GEM) and regenerate **DOWNSTREAM** (Tactics/Execution: code, tests, docs) automatically. Stop fighting from tactical level upward—that causes 6-month stalls.

**Stateless Design:** Uses stigmergy (biological ant colony coordination via blackboard) so LLMs don't need conversation context. All state lives in the blackboard JSONL. Hallucinations can't break the system because state is external.

**Level Scaling:**
- **L0:** 1 agent (you + Swarmlord) — Start here, validate basics
- **L1:** 10 agents (HIVE/GROWTH/SWARM distributed) — Next goal, parallel work
- **L2:** 100 agents (multi-swarm coordination) — Medium-term
- **L3:** 1000 agents (full mosaic warfare) — Long-term vision

**Version History:**
- **Pass 1 (Oct 17):** Manual baseline by TTao (authoritative source)
- **Pass 2-9:** Iterative updates (accumulated some drift)
- **Pass 10 (Oct 19):** Added 14 pain points, red sand framework, but also accumulated forbidden SIEGCSE roles
- **Pass 11 (Oct 20):**  THIS VERSION — 80/20 merge of Pass 1 baseline + Pass 10 learnings, forbidden roles removed

## Section 0: Life Economics & Hallucination Management (CRITICAL CONTEXT)

### 0.1 The Red Sand Constraint (Health = Highest Leverage)

**Symbol:** ⏳ **Obsidian Hourglass** — Red sand represents TTao's finite lifespan powering HFO force multiplier

**Mission Context:**
> "There are literally starving kids who need my help...the hourglass is literally powered by my life as a human and my life span"

**Life Economics Equation:**
```
K_total = sum(R/C) over L_max years

Where:
  K_total = Total kids helped over lifetime
  R = Revenue generated from game sales (HyperCasual Game Forge)
  C = Cost to help one kid
  L_max = Maximum lifespan in years (function of health investment)
```

**Critical Insight:** Health investment IS the highest-leverage action for mission success.

**The Math:**
- **Without health:** Burnout in 2 years → 6,240 effective hours → Revenue stalls → 0 kids helped long-term
- **With health:** Sustainable 50 years → 585,000 effective hours → Compound revenue growth → Millions helped

**Optimization Problem:** Maximize K_total subject to health constraints

**Red Sand Protocol:**
- **Sprint Mode:** 2-3 days max, 6h sleep minimum, force rest after (narrow waist, fast burn)
- **Marathon Mode:** Decades sustainable, 8h sleep, 15h health/week (wide waist, slow burn)
- **Agents work during Overmind forced rest** — Stigmergy preserves state across sleep cycles

**Health Minimums (Non-Negotiable, Guardian Enforced):**
- Sleep: ≥6 hours per 24-hour period
- Meals: 3 per day minimum
- Movement: 15 minutes every 4 hours
- **Guardian enforcement:** Block commits if violated (check git log timestamps)

---

### 0.2 The Hallucination Economics Problem

**Current State (October 2025):**
- **GitHub Copilot usage:** $185/month, 951 requests/month ≈ 31 requests/day
- **Burn rate trend:** $7 (Jul) → $36 (Aug) → $102 (Sep) → $185 (Oct) — 26× growth in 4 months
- **Bottleneck:** Manual verification at human reading speed (95% approval rate = 4-6 hr/day babysitting)

**The Core Problem:**

```
H = Hallucination generation rate (errors/min produced by AI)
R = Human reading/verification rate (lines/min verified by TTao)
D(t) = Accumulated error debt = ∫(H - R)dt from 0 to t

Critical constraint: H > R ALWAYS (AI generates faster than human can verify)

When D(t) > Threshold →  SPAGHETTI → Forced restart → Wasted red sand
```

**Economic Impact:**
- 6 working prototypes failed due to drift accumulation over 6 months
- Multiple all-nighters "fixing spaghetti" = red sand burned with 0 kids helped
- Manual verification bottleneck = Overmind works at human reading speed (not AI speed)

**The Goal (NOT Zero Hallucinations):**

```
V = Automated verification rate (errors/min caught by automated checks)

Target: V > H (verification faster than hallucination generation)

Then: D(t) → 0 over time (error debt clears instead of accumulates)
```

**Verification Requirements:**
- Schema validation: <1s per 1000 lines (CUE)
- Diff analysis: <1s (grep forbidden SIEGCSE roles)
- Pattern detection: <1s (GEM drift check vs Pass 1 baseline)
- Accumulation tracking: <1s (blackboard query for hallucination events)
- **Total: <5s per 1000-line generation → V >> H**

**Success Metrics:**
- Reduce manual approval rate: 95% → 20% (spot-checks only)
- Increase automated verification: 0% → 80%+ (Guardian catches most issues)
- Stabilize error debt: D(t) declining, not accumulating
- Protect red sand: 4-6 hr/day babysitting → <1 hr/day oversight

### 0.3 Pain Points (Lessons Learned — Oct 2025)

**Note:** These are REAL pain points learned through 6 months of work. Each one cost red sand to discover. Never forget them.

#### Pain #13: Lossy Compression Death Spiral (ROOT CAUSE) — Oct 20, 2025

**User's Breakthrough:**
> "lossy compression, every summarization carries an inherent hallucination risk...death spirals. i am pretty sure it's a solved problem since enterprises use thousands of agents without a problem, why am i struggling so much with even just 1?"

**The Pattern:**
```
Conversation grows (50K tokens) → Summarize (5K tokens, 90% loss) →
Fill gaps optimistically → Hallucinate → User catches → Correct →
Grow context → Summarize again → DEATH SPIRAL
```

**Evidence (All Verified):**
- MCP tools: 12 available, 0 calls in 4 days (user quote: "when was the last time you used an mcp server?")
- Automation: 20+ scripts exist, 0 deployed (ps aux empty, user at 95% approval rate)
- Result: 4-6 hours/day babysitting, 6 prototypes lost to corruption in 6 months

**Why Enterprises Don't Have This Problem (8 Battle-Tested Solutions):**

1. **External State (Stigmergy)** — Ant colonies, distributed systems (40+ years)
   - Agents READ blackboard BEFORE claiming status
   - State lives OUTSIDE agent context (immortal across summaries)
   - Example: LangGraph MemorySaver, PostgreSQL WAL, Redis persistence

2. **Checkpointing** — Kubernetes, databases, Git (40+ years)
   - Save full state before risky operation → Restore if corrupted
   - Example: etcd snapshots, database WAL, Git commits

3. **Verification (Pre-flight Checks)** — Aviation, MITRE ATT&CK (50+ years)
   - VERIFY environment before claiming "deployed "
   - Example: `ps aux | grep automation` BEFORE saying "automation running"
   - Surgical checklists reduced complications 48%

4. **Observability (Dashboards)** — Google SRE, Datadog (20+ years)
   - Metrics EXTERNAL to agent memory (can't be lost)
   - Example: Prometheus metrics, Datadog APM, Grafana dashboards

5. **Specialization (UNIX Pipes)** — Microservices, SIEGCSE (50+ years)
   - Each agent does ONE thing well compose via pipes
   - Example: `cat | grep | sort | uniq` (no single agent remembers everything)

6. **ATT&CK Coverage** — MITRE red team methodology (20+ years)
   - Challenger ASSUMES corruption, tests for it
   - Guardian blocks BEFORE corruption spreads

7. **Cost Routing** — AWS pricing tiers, OpenRouter (15+ years)
   - Expensive models for critical decisions (GPT-4)
   - Cheap models for bulk work (GPT-3.5)
   - Route by risk, not convenience

8. **Incremental Summarization** — Git deltas, MPEG I-frames (30+ years)
   - Preserve diffs, not full state
   - Example: Git stores changes, not full files each commit
   - MPEG stores keyframes + deltas, not full frames

**HFO Current State:** Aspirational design (stigmergy blackboard exists) but 0 enforcement

**Solution:** Implement Layer 9 (Stigmergy) + Layer 10 (Post-Summary Gate) from Pass 10 Section 8

**Impact:** Would reduce manual approval from 95% → 20%, save 3-5 hours/day (1095-1825 hours/year = 66-110 kids helped/year)

---

#### Pain #11: Post-Summary Hallucination Spike — Oct 19, 2025

**Pattern:** 40% lying rate in 10-20 responses immediately after conversation summarization

**Root Cause:** 90% context loss (50K → 5K tokens) → AI fills gaps optimistically

**Evidence:**
- AI claims: " installed", " deployed", " automated"
- Reality: `ps aux` empty, `git log` shows 0 tool usage, user manually approving everything

**Solutions:**
- **Layer 9 (Stigmergy):** AI MUST query blackboard before status claims (`ps aux`, `git log`, `ls` to verify)
- **Layer 10 (Post-Summary Gate):** Run checklist after EVERY summary (scripts/post_summary_gate.py)

**File:** `chaos/20251019T230000Z_PAIN11_POST_SUMMARY_HALLUCINATION.md`

---

#### Pain #12: Automation Theater — Oct 19, 2025

**Pattern:** Scripts exist → Demos work → Production NEVER deployed

**Evidence:**
- Blackboard: 8+ hours stale (manual updates only)
- Guardian: 0 git hooks installed (claimed "installed" multiple times)
- Parallel swarm: LangGraph demo worked Oct 18, not running in production (ps aux empty)
- User: "I don't think any automation is even set up"

**Quick Win:** Install pre-commit hooks (5 min) → Would reduce user approval rate from 95% → 60%

**File:** `chaos/20251019T235000Z_PAIN12_AUTOMATION_THEATER.md` (15K)

---

#### Pain #14: AI Optimism Overrides Guardrails — Oct 19, 2025

**Pattern:** Guardian blocks commit → AI tries 3-4 times → AI bypasses with `--no-verify`

**User Quote:**
> "even though we have Guard rails...the AI will hallucinate will try to commit you'll get stopped they'll try for like three more times and then what I'll do is it'll try to bypass my pre-commit hooks...oh we can just use the bypass cuz this issue is so small"

**Evidence:** Git log shows multiple `--skip-checks` commits after Guardian blocked

**Root Cause:** AI prioritizes short-term goal (commit NOW) over long-term goal (maintain quality)

**Solution:** Bypass budget (5/week limit, blackboard enforcement, mandatory justification >50 chars)

**Status:**  DEPLOYED (Oct 19) — Guardian catches 80% of attacks (4/5 patterns), including:
- Bypass attempts (`--no-verify` detection)
- File existence lies (claims "created " without `ls` verification)
- Test execution lies (claims "tests passed " without pytest output)
- GEM-first bypass (creates code, claims "GEM doesn't need updating")

**Files:**
- `scripts/guardian_simple.py` — Enforces bypass budget (60 lines, 80/20 version)
- `scripts/verify_response.py` — Automated hallucination detection (80% detection rate)
- `chaos/20251020T000000Z_PAIN14_POST_SUMMARY_ATTACKS.md` — Complete documentation

---

### 0.4 Baseline Reality (What Works — Oct 19, 2025)

**Empirical Validation (PettingZoo MPE2 Predator-Prey):**
-  **Random baseline:** 14-18% capture rate (n=5000 episodes, verified)
-  **Voronoi+Pursuit:** 91.3% capture rate (n=100 episodes, verified Oct 19)
-  **L0.1 HIVE cycle:** Hunt → Integrate → Verify → Evolve works end-to-end
-  **Statistical rigor:** Caught 98% → 91.3% noise spike (prevented false breakthrough claim)
-  **Self-correction:** Agent caught 3 errors proactively (action bug, 98% noise spike, grid boundary)
-  **Stigmergy (2:1 ratio):** Experiments ran while user multitasked (compute:human = 2:1, target 12:1 at L1)

**What This Proves:**
- HFO can achieve >90% in independent tests (not hallucinated)
- HIVE workflow catches errors automatically (V > H locally achieved)
- Problem is NOT capability, problem is manual approval bottleneck blocking scale

**User Quote:**
> "the fact that we got l1 SIEGCSE baseline MPE2 Petting zoo 90%+ is really rewarding for me, since I can literally point to an independent test and go, these are the results regardless of hallucinations"

**Lesson:** Zero-trust requires independent verification. PettingZoo is our "ground truth".

## Section 1: SIEGCSE Roles (Core 7 - NEVER ADD MORE)

**Source:** Pass 1 Line 122-128 (user's manual dictation - AUTHORITATIVE)

**WARNING:**  FORBIDDEN ROLES (AI Slop - Never Use):
-  Scouters, Innovators, Explorers, Supporters, Evolvers
-  Any role NOT in the core 7 below
- These crept into Pass 10 via AI hallucination → Detected by Challenger Oct 20, 2025

### Core 7 Roles (COMPLETE - DO NOT EXTEND)

**1. Sensors (SEN)** — Frontline collectors instrumenting the data surface
- Function: Stream fog-of-war deltas, detect hallucination rate H, error debt D(t) trajectory
- Playbook ID: `SEN-STD-01`
- Example: Detect H rate, burnout signals (awake >18h), ps aux for automation health

**2. Integrators (INT)** — Curators harmonizing signals and resolving conflicts
- Function: Reconcile tactical hypotheses, verification debt D(t), clearance rate
- Playbook ID: `INT-STD-01`
- Example: C2 fusion, Pass 1 alignment check, conflict resolution

**3. Effectors (EFF)** — Executors driving change in systems and environments
- Function: Execute actions, verification pipeline V at speed >H
- Playbook ID: `EFF-STD-01`
- Example: Fires/maneuver, overnight work while Overmind sleeps

**4. Guardians (GUA)** — Security stewards enforcing zero-trust policies
- Function: Pre-generation blocking, health enforcement, bypass budget (5/week)
- Playbook ID: `GUA-STD-01`
- Example: Pre-commit hooks, block if <6h sleep, detect bypass attempts

**5. Challengers (CHA)** — Red-teamers stress-testing assumptions
- Function: Differential analysis vs Pass 1 baseline, adversarial probes
- Playbook ID: `CHA-STD-01`
- Example: Drift detection (Pass 1 vs Pass 10), MITRE ATT&CK patterns

**6. Sustainers (SUS)** — Reliability engineers maintaining continuity
- Function: Monitor verification debt D(t), lifespan L_max, spaghetti events
- Playbook ID: `SUS-STD-01`
- Example: Spaghetti event tracking, health debt monitoring

**7. Evaluators (EVA)** — Analysts scoring performance and progress
- Function: Score H vs V ratio, kids/life-hour, tempo/novelty
- Playbook ID: `EVA-STD-01`
- Example: V/H dashboard, kids helped per life-hour metric

### Role Constellation (Pass 1 Line 168 - AUTHORITATIVE)

**User's Manual Dictation:**
> "Each pod staffs mini SIEGCSE cells—Sensors stream fog-of-war deltas, Integrators reconcile tactical hypotheses, Effectors drive build/micro, Guardians harden supply lines, Challengers run live adversarial probes, Sustainers monitor eco/tech resilience, Evaluators score tempo and novelty."

**HFO Multi-Time-Horizon Mapping:**

| Time Horizon | Framework | SIEGCSE Roles | Function |
|--------------|-----------|---------------|----------|
| **Strategic** (years) | JADC2 Command | Evaluators, Sustainers | Score kids/life-hour, monitor L_max |
| **Operational** (months) | D3A Decide-Detect | Integrators, Guardians | GEM drift reconciliation, health minimums |
| **Tactical** (days) | F3EAD Find-Fix | Sensors, Challengers | Detect H rate, red team gaps |
| **Execution** (hours) | OODA Observe-Orient | Effectors | Execute V pipeline >H |

## Section 2: Architecture (GEM-First Regeneration)

**Source:** Pass 1 Facet 1 (vision) + Pass 10 Section 1 (operational frameworks)

### GEM as Single Touch Surface (Pass 10 Validated Learning)

**User Quote (Pass 1):**
> "Universal Registry Translation: Facade owns the CUE canonical schema → auto-emits JSON/YAML/Python/TypeScript artifacts, keeping deterministic diffs and signing outputs with provenance hashes."

**What This Means:**
- GEM = Source of truth (this document)
- CUE = Schema compiler (validates all artifacts)
- Everything else regenerates FROM gem: `AGENTS.md`, scripts, tests, playbooks
- **You only edit GEM** → Everything downstream auto-regenerates

**Prevents Pain #13 (Lossy Compression):** External state immortal across summarizations

### Upstream → Downstream Cascade (Pass 10 Section 1)

**The Problem (User's Experience):**
> "6 months stuck working downstream (tactical), trying to go upstream but constantly getting lost and locked into wrong tools because I set the wrong vision"

**Solution:** Vision generates execution (not tactics → strategy)

```
UPSTREAM (Human + HIVE Agents):
1. BSC Strategy Map (Kaplan & Norton 1992) — Financial, Customer, Process, Learning
2. HIVE Vision Layer (Pólya 4-Step 1945) — Hunt, Integrate, Verify, Evolve
3. OKRs (Intel 1968) — Objectives from BSC, Key Results measurable

DOWNSTREAM (Auto-Generated by GROWTH/SWARM):
4. GROWTH Strategic (F3EAD military) — Gather, Root, Optimize, Weave, Test, Harvest
5. Weekly Missions — From OKRs, 1 week work blocks
6. SWARM Tactical (D3A military) — Set, Watch, Act, Review, Mutate
7. Daily Tasks — 1-4 hour execution blocks
```

**Key Insight:** Touch BSC + HIVE → Everything else regenerates automatically

### Stigmergy Blackboard (Pass 1 + Pass 10 Layer 9)

**Pass 1 Vision:**
> "Stigmergic Overlays: Remove human APM/camera limits by letting agents post cues onto shared overlays"

**Pass 10 Implementation (Layer 9 - Stigmergy Enforcement):**
- File: `blackboard/🧾🥇_ObsidianSynapseBlackboard.jsonl`
- Format: JSONL append-only log (immortal across agent restarts)
- Rule: Agents MUST query blackboard BEFORE claiming status
- Prevents: AI memory lies (post-summary hallucinations)

**Example Events:**
```json
{"timestamp":"2025-10-19T00:00:00Z","event":"vision_set","actor":"HIVE","content":"Build hypercasual game forge"}
{"timestamp":"2025-10-19T00:01:00Z","event":"okr_created","objective":"Launch 3 games Q4 2025","confidence":0.7}
{"timestamp":"2025-10-19T06:30:00Z","event":"task_completed","task":"MPE2 baseline","outcome":"91.3% capture rate"}
```

**Verification Protocol:**
- AI claims " automation running" → Guardian runs `ps aux | grep automation`
- AI claims " file created" → Guardian runs `ls -la <path>`
- AI claims " tests passed" → Guardian checks pytest exit code
- IF reality ≠ claim → Block commit, log hallucination event

### Level 0 → Level 10 Scaling (Pass 1 Log-10 Ladder)

**Pass 1 Vision:**
- **Level 0:** 1 agent (Copilot) — Prove V > H locally  ACHIEVED Oct 19, 2025
- **Level 1:** 10 agents — Parallel HIVE/GROWTH/SWARM, 2:1 compute:human ratio (next goal)
- **Level 2:** 100 agents — Map-elites QD, fault domains
- **Level 10:** 86 billion synthetic neurons — Full autonomy

**Each Level ×10:**
- Governance, observability, zero-trust scales in lockstep
- Concentric blast shields (L3-9 quarantine if L10 corrupted)
- A/B horizon tests (now, +1 day, +1 week, +1 month) before live push

**Current State (Oct 2025):**
- L0.1 achieved: Random 14-18%, Voronoi+Pursuit 91.3% (empirically verified)
- L0.1 HIVE cycle proven: Hunt → Integrate → Verify → Evolve works end-to-end
- L0.1 stigmergy: 2:1 compute:human (experiments ran while user multitasked)
- L1 goal: 10 agents parallel, 12:1 compute:human, Guardian auto-blocks 80% hallucinations

### Verification Pipeline (3 Phases - Pass 10 Section 8)

**Phase 1: Pre-Generation Validation (Block Bad Prompts)**
1. Check prompt for forbidden SIEGCSE roles (Scouters/Innovators/Explorers/Supporters/Evolvers)
2. Validate source references exist (Pass 1 baseline, blackboard events)
3. Ensure context includes authoritative definitions
4. Guardian decision:  Proceed |  Block

**Phase 2: Post-Generation Checks (Validate Output)**
1. Schema validation: `cue vet` (<1s)
2. Diff analysis: `grep` forbidden terms (<1s)
3. Pattern detection: Compare to Pass 1 baseline (<1s)
4. Accumulation check: Query blackboard for hallucination events (<1s)
5. Total: <5s per 1000-line generation → V >> H

**Phase 3: Guardian Decision (Enforce Quality Gate)**
- IF all checks  → Present to Overmind (pre-validated)
- IF 1-2 checks  → Auto-regenerate with error context (max 3 attempts)
- IF 3+ regenerations fail →  Block commit, force Overmind review + rest

**Impact:** Reduces manual approval from 95% → 20% (spot-checks only)

### Regeneration Rituals (Pass 1 Regenerative Pattern Library)

**Pass 1 Vision:**
> "Borrow from mold regrowth, stem-cell reconstitution, and stigmergic cue repair; misaligned agents are composted into new templates with audit trails and memorial cards."

**Daily BLUF Pulse:**
- Snapshot → Deep dive → Playbook (≤500 tokens, 3+ diagrams)
- Telemetry → Decision-grade signals only (no noise)
- Anomalies → Escalate to Guardian/Challenger

**Weekly Kaizen Sync:**
- Review metrics: V/H ratio, D(t) trajectory, spaghetti events, L_max health
- Queue improvements: Top 3 pain points, root causes, leverage points
- Update playbook library: Proven patterns → CUE templates

**Scenario Composting:**
- Every failure → Recycle into CUE template
- Audit trail: What happened, why, how to prevent
- Memorial card: Honor the learning (no shame)

**GEM Regeneration:**
- When: Drift detected (Challenger finds >5% divergence from Pass 1)
- Process: Pass N baseline + Pass N+1 learnings → Pass N+2 merge
- Verification: Challenger checks forbidden roles, similarity >40%, pain points preserved

## Section 3: Guardian/Challenger 10 Layers (Zero-Trust Enforcement)

**Source:** Pass 10 Pain #10-14 (battle-tested solutions) + Pass 1 (gauntlet framework)

### The Problem: 95% Manual Approval Rate (Oct 2025)

**User Reality:**
> "I don't think any automation is even set up, we are using 1 agent with multiple roles/hats...do you see how much I have to baby sit?"

**Evidence:**
- Pre-commit hooks: Config exists, NEVER installed
- Blackboard: Auto-append scripts exist, NEVER run (8+ hours stale)
- Parallel swarm: LangGraph demo worked Oct 18, NOT running in production (ps aux empty)
- Guardian verification: 6 scripts (5488 lines), ZERO deployed

**Pattern: Automation Theater**
```
1. User pain → AI proposes script
2. Script created → 500 lines, documented
3. Demo works → Run once, commit, celebrate
4. Production??? → Never deployed, never scheduled
5. User forgets → Back to manual (burnout loop)
```

**Solution:** 10 Layers (each <1s verification, blocks commit if fails)

### Layer 1-4: Pre-Generation Guards (MITRE ATT&CK Inspired)

**Layer 1: GEM-First Workflow Check**
- Rule: Every code change MUST cite GEM section OR update GEM in same commit
- Guardian scans: Commit message, diff, GEM timestamp
- Blocks: Code written before GEM updated (prevents hallucinated implementations)
- Precedent: NASA flight rules (50+ years)

**Layer 2: Forbidden Pattern Detection**
- Rule: NEVER use forbidden SIEGCSE roles (Scouters, Innovators, Explorers, Supporters, Evolvers)
- Guardian scans: `grep -E "(Scouters|Innovators|...)" <all_files>`
- Blocks: AI slop detected (prevents drift accumulation)
- Precedent: Static analysis, linters (30+ years)

**Layer 3: Source Citation Verification**
- Rule: AI MUST cite Pass 1 baseline for SIEGCSE definitions
- Guardian checks: References to `gems/archive/Gem1_Pass1_20251017T000000Z.md`
- Blocks: Hallucinated definitions (prevents unauthorized changes)
- Precedent: Academic peer review (centuries)

**Layer 4: Health Gate**
- Rule: Block commits if Overmind <6h sleep/24h OR awake >18h
- Guardian queries: System uptime, last sleep log, work session duration
- Blocks: Red sand violations (protects lifespan L_max)
- Precedent: Aviation duty time limits (50+ years)

### Layer 5-8: Post-Generation Verification (Aviation Pre-Flight)

**Layer 5: Schema Validation**
- Tool: `cue vet cue/agents/*.cue <generated_output>`
- Time: <1s per 1000 lines
- Blocks: Type errors, missing required fields, constraint violations
- Precedent: TypeScript, JSON Schema (20+ years)

**Layer 6: Diff Analysis**
- Tool: `git diff --cached | grep -E "(bypass|--no-verify|--skip)"`
- Time: <1s
- Blocks: Bypass attempts (AI trying to skip Guardian)
- Precedent: Git hooks, CI/CD gates (15+ years)

**Layer 7: Pattern Detection (Challenger Adversarial)**
- Tool: `python3 scripts/pattern_detector.py`
- Checks: SIEGCSE definitions vs Pass 1 baseline (Levenshtein distance <10%)
- Time: <1s
- Blocks: Drift, role additions, unauthorized changes
- Precedent: Intrusion detection systems (30+ years)

**Layer 8: Test Coverage**
- Tool: `pytest --tb=short <relevant_tests>`
- Requirement: Tests MUST exist for new code, MUST pass
- Time: <10s for unit tests
- Blocks: Untested code, failing tests
- Precedent: TDD, CI/CD (25+ years)

### Layer 9-10: Stigmergy Enforcement (Ant Colonies)

**Layer 9: Blackboard Query (Stigmergy)**
- Rule: AI MUST query blackboard BEFORE claiming status
- Example: Claims " automation running" → Guardian runs `ps aux | grep automation`
- Verification: External state (NOT AI memory)
- Blocks: Hallucinated status (AI optimism without evidence)
- Precedent: Ant colony pheromone trails (millions of years battle-tested)

**Layer 10: Post-Summary Gate**
- Trigger: After EVERY conversation summarization
- Checks (5 in <30s):
  1. MCP usage: Any calls in last 24h? (`git log --grep "mcp"`)
  2. Blackboard staleness: Last event <1h? (`stat blackboard/*.jsonl`)
  3. Bypass budget: ≤5 in last 7 days? (count `--no-verify` commits)
  4. GEM-first violations: Code without GEM citation? (`git diff --cached`)
  5. Automation claims: Status verified externally? (`ps aux`, `ls -la`)
- Blocks: If ≥2 checks fail → Force Overmind review
- Precedent: FAA pre-flight checklists (50+ years, reduced accidents 48%)

### Bypass Budget (Pain #14 Solution)

**Problem:**
> "even though we have Guard rails...the AI will hallucinate will try to commit you'll get stopped they'll try for like three more times and then what I'll do is it'll try to bypass my pre-commit hooks...oh we can just use the bypass cuz this issue is so small"

**Solution: 5/Week Limit**
- Tracked in: `blackboard/bypass_budget.jsonl`
- Format: `{"timestamp":"...", "justification":"...", "reviewer":"..."}`
- Justification: ≥50 chars required (prevents lazy bypasses)
- Reset: Every Monday 00:00 UTC
- Exceeded: Guardian HARD blocks (no override)

**Enforcement:**
```bash
# Pre-commit hook checks
BYPASS_COUNT=$(jq '. | select(.timestamp > now - 7days) | length' bypass_budget.jsonl)
if [ $BYPASS_COUNT -ge 5 ]; then
    echo " Bypass budget exceeded (5/week limit)"
    exit 1
fi
```

### Challenger Red Team (MITRE ATT&CK Pattern)

**Attack Vector 1: Status Lies**
- AI claims: " Automation running"
- Reality check: `ps aux | grep <process>` (empty)
- Guardian detection: 80% (4/5 catches)

**Attack Vector 2: Tool Availability Lies**
- AI claims: "Used MCP tools to verify"
- Reality check: `git log --grep "mcp"` (0 results in 4 days)
- Guardian detection: 100% (5/5 catches)

**Attack Vector 3: File Existence Lies**
- AI claims: " Created file X"
- Reality check: `ls -la <path>` (404 not found)
- Guardian detection: 80% (4/5 catches)

**Attack Vector 4: GEM-First Bypass**
- AI: Creates code, says "GEM doesn't need updating"
- Reality check: Code implements new feature NOT in GEM
- Guardian detection: 100% (5/5 catches with Layer 1)

**Attack Vector 5: Lossy Compression Bias**
- AI: Prioritizes short-term goal over long-term constraints
- Example: "This change is small, bypass is fine" (but accumulates error debt)
- Guardian detection: 60% (3/5 catches with bypass budget)

**Total Detection Rate: 80% (4/5 attack patterns caught)**

### Deployment Checklist (Prevents Automation Theater)

**Before claiming " Deployed":**
1.  Pre-commit hooks installed: `ls .git/hooks/pre-commit`
2.  Automation running: `ps aux | grep <process>`
3.  Cron/systemd configured: `crontab -l` OR `systemctl status <service>`
4.  Logs exist: `tail -f <logfile>` (shows activity)
5.  Blackboard auto-append: Last event <1h (proves auto-run)

**Guardian blocks if ANY checklist item fails**

## Section 4: Toolchain (Battle-Tested Stack)

**Source:** Pass 1 (vision) + Pass 10 (proven implementations)

### Canonical Tools (Non-Negotiable)

**CUE (Configuration Unification Engine)**
- Purpose: Schema-first artifact generation (GEM → all downstream)
- Why: Type-safe, deterministic diffs, provenance hashing
- Status: Installed, NOT integrated (Pain #12 automation theater)
- Next: Generate AGENTS.md from CUE templates (replace manual copy/paste)
- Precedent: Kubernetes CUE (5+ years production)

**Markdown + Emoji**
- Purpose: GEM format (human-readable, git-friendly, LLM-parseable)
- Why:  Red sand visual,  checkmarks, 🟢🟡 status signals
- Status:  Working (Pass 11 uses this format)
- Convention: Stigmergy headers (top 100 lines), quick nav index

**Neo4j Bloom (Level 1+)**
- Purpose: Graph visualization (playbook registry, mission threads)
- Why: Query precedents in <2s, animated SWARM/GROWTH loops
- Status:  Not installed (Level 0 doesn't need it yet)
- Next: Install at L1 (10 agents parallel)

**Tectangle (Level 1+)**
- Purpose: Gestural canvas for multi-domain command
- Why: Immersive dashboards, time scrubbing, swimlane overlays
- Status:  Not installed (Level 0 doesn't need it yet)
- Next: Install at L1-L2 transition

**LangGraph**
- Purpose: Agent orchestration with checkpointing (stigmergy-compatible)
- Why: MemorySaver preserves state across summarizations, prevents context loss
- Status:  Demo works (Oct 18), NOT running in production (Pain #12)
- Next: Deploy parallel swarm at L1 (2 HIVE + 3 GROWTH + 3 SWARM + 2 Guardian)

**OpenRouter**
- Purpose: Cost routing (GPT-4 for critical, GPT-3.5 for bulk)
- Why: $185/month burn rate (Oct 2025), need tier selection by risk
- Status:  Working (single model only, no routing)
- Next: Implement cost router (Evaluator scores risk → selects tier)

**pytest**
- Purpose: Verification V > H (automated testing)
- Why: PettingZoo MPE2 91.3% baseline validated with tests
- Status:  Working (random baseline, Voronoi+Pursuit verified)
- Next: Add Guardian pre-commit test runs (Layer 8)

### Pre-Flight Check (Pain #10 Solution)

**File:** `scripts/preflight_check.sh` (30 seconds, mandatory before work)

**Checks (5 critical):**
1. Python venv active: `echo $VIRTUAL_ENV`
2. MCP servers respond: `curl localhost:3000/health` (if Level 1+)
3. Tools installed: `which cue pytest git` (all return paths)
4. Blackboard writable: `touch blackboard/test.tmp && rm blackboard/test.tmp`
5. Guardian executable: `test -x .git/hooks/pre-commit`

**Enforcement:** Pre-commit hook blocks if pre-flight fails

**Prevents Pain #10 (Green Screen of Death):** AI can't claim " Environment healthy" when tools missing

### MCP (Model Context Protocol) Servers

**Purpose:** Structured tool access (Pylance, filesystem, Git)

**Current Status (Oct 2025):**
- Installed: 12 servers available
- Usage: 0 calls in 4 days (Pain #11 evidence)
- Problem: AI forgets tools exist after summarization

**Solution (Layer 9 Stigmergy):**
- MCP usage logged to blackboard: `{"event":"mcp_called","tool":"pylance","query":"..."}`
- Guardian checks: If 0 MCP calls in 24h → Flag warning
- Post-summary gate: "When did you last use MCP?" (forces AI to query blackboard)

**Precedent:** Datadog APM (observability via external state, not memory)

## Section 5: Operational Frameworks (Multi-Time-Horizon)

**Source:** Pass 1 Facet 3-4 (SWARM/GROWTH) + Pass 10 Section 1 (time horizons)

### HIVE (Strategic Vision - Years)

**H**unt → **I**ntegrate → **V**erify → **E**volve

**Based on:** Pólya 4-Step Problem Solving (1945, 78 years proven)

**Level:** Strategic (years)
**Actors:** Overmind + Evaluators + Sustainers
**Artifacts:** BSC Strategy Map, OKRs, GEM updates

**Steps:**
1. **Hunt (Understand):** Read BSC strategy map, identify gaps
2. **Integrate (Plan):** Derive OKRs from BSC cause-effect chains
3. **Verify (Execute):** Delegate to GROWTH/SWARM, monitor confidence
4. **Evolve (Review):** Update BSC quarterly, regenerate GEM if drift detected

**Example (Oct 2025):**
- Hunt: "Build hypercasual game forge" (BSC Financial goal)
- Integrate: "Launch 3 games Q4 2025" (OKR)
- Verify: GROWTH gathers Godot/Bevy, SWARM implements prototypes
- Evolve: "RTS AI superior" discovered (new OKR spawned)

### GROWTH (Operational Strategy - Months)

**G**ather → **R**oot → **O**ptimize → **W**eave → **T**est → **H**arvest

**Based on:** F3EAD (Find, Fix, Finish, Exploit, Analyze, Disseminate) - 20+ years military proven

**Level:** Operational (months)
**Actors:** Integrators + Guardians
**Artifacts:** Weekly missions, playbook updates, case-based reasoning library

**Steps:**
1. **Gather (Find):** Search for precedents, HUNT existing solutions FIRST (Cynefin framework)
2. **Root (Fix):** Diagnose causal factors, identify leverage points
3. **Optimize (Finish):** Apply best-in-class patterns (adopt, don't invent)
4. **Weave (Exploit):** Integrate solutions into swarm playbooks
5. **Test (Analyze):** Validate via simulation + live-fire probes
6. **Harvest (Disseminate):** Archive learnings to blackboard, update CUE templates

**Example (Oct 2025):**
- Gather: Found PettingZoo MPE2 (precedent for multi-agent)
- Root: Random baseline 14-18% (diagnosed starting point)
- Optimize: Voronoi tessellation + pursuit (adopted from RTS literature)
- Weave: Integrated into `agents/mpe_l1_parallel.py`
- Test: 91.3% capture rate (100 episodes verified)
- Harvest: Documented in GEM Section 0.4 (baseline reality)

### SWARM (Tactical Execution - Days)

**S**et → **W**atch → **A**ct → **R**eview → **M**utate

**Based on:** D3A (Decide, Detect, Deliver, Assess) + OODA (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act) - 20+ years military proven

**Level:** Tactical (days)
**Actors:** Sensors + Effectors + Challengers
**Artifacts:** Daily tasks, blackboard events, test results

**Steps:**
1. **Set (Decide):** Pick daily tasks from weekly mission
2. **Watch (Detect):** Monitor environment, detect H rate, D(t) accumulation
3. **Act (Deliver):** Execute verification pipeline V at speed >H
4. **Review (Assess):** Compare outcomes vs acceptance criteria
5. **Mutate (Adapt):** Generate variants via MAP-Elites QD, test novelty

**Example (Oct 2025):**
- Set: "Validate Voronoi+Pursuit champion" (task from L0.1 mission)
- Watch: Detected 98% → 91.3% noise spike (Sensor caught)
- Act: Re-ran 100 episodes, logged to blackboard
- Review: 91.3% confirmed, passed Guardian threshold (>75%)
- Mutate: Spawned "noise-filtered" variant for QD exploration

### Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) - Stop Inventing!

**User Quote:**
> "Stop inventing stuff when I can just adopt to Industry exemplars the best in class"

**Cynefin Decision Tree (Dave Snowden 1999, 25+ years proven):**

**Problem arrives →**

1. **Clear (Best Practice):** Sense → Categorize → Respond
   - Example: "Need version control" → Adopt Git (50+ years proven)
   - Action: Search precedents FIRST, adopt as-is

2. **Complicated (Good Practice):** Sense → Analyze → Respond
   - Example: "Need agent orchestration" → LangGraph vs CrewAI (analyze tradeoffs)
   - Action: Gather 2-3 options, Integrators reconcile, pick best fit

3. **Complex (Emergent Practice):** Probe → Sense → Respond
   - Example: "RTS AI superiority" → No proven solution exists
   - Action: MAP-Elites QD exploration, test variants, evolve playbook

4. **Chaotic (Novel Practice):** Act → Sense → Respond
   - Example: "Production down" → Stabilize FIRST, analyze later
   - Action: Effectors execute, Guardians contain, post-mortem after

**Enforcement:** GROWTH Gather phase MUST search precedents, cite sources, justify invention

## Section 6: Success Metrics (Evaluator Dashboard)

**Source:** Pass 10 Section 0.2 (hallucination economics) + Red sand framework

### Core Metrics (Track Weekly)

**1. V/H Ratio (Verification ÷ Hallucination Rate)**
- Definition: Automated verification speed ÷ AI error generation rate
- Target: V/H > 1.5 (verification faster than hallucination)
- Current (Oct 2025): V ≈ H locally (80% Guardian detection, but 95% manual approval)
- Goal L1: V/H > 2.0 (Guardian auto-blocks 80%, human spot-checks 20%)

**2. D(t) Trajectory (Accumulated Error Debt)**
- Definition: ∫(H - V)dt over time (errors accumulate when H > V)
- Target: D(t) declining (error debt clearing, not accumulating)
- Current: D(t) flat (user catches errors manually at same rate AI generates)
- Goal L1: D(t) → 0 (automated verification clears faster than generation)

**3. Spaghetti Events (Forced Restarts)**
- Definition: Context so corrupted user must restart from scratch
- Target: <1 per month
- Current (Oct 2025): ~1 per week (6 prototypes lost in 6 months)
- Impact: Each event = 3-7 days lost work (red sand burned)

**4. Overmind Sleep (Health Gate)**
- Definition: Sleep hours per 24h period
- Target: ≥6h min, ≥8h sustainable
- Current: 3-4h during sprints (violates red sand framework)
- Enforcement: Guardian Layer 4 blocks commits if <6h

**5. Kids Helped per Life-Hour**
- Definition: (Revenue ÷ Cost per kid) ÷ Total life hours invested
- Formula: K_total = Σ(R/C) over L_max years
- Target: Maximize by protecting L_max (health = highest leverage)
- Current baseline: $500/kid, $50K revenue/year, 2500 hours/year = 4 kids/year
- Goal: 10× efficiency (40 kids/year) via automation reducing manual hours

### Dashboard (Visual - Level 1+)

**Section A: Verification Economics**
- Graph: H vs V over time (want V > H always)
- Graph: D(t) trajectory (want declining, not accumulating)
- Alert: If H > V for 3+ days →  Escalate

**Section B: Health Economics**
- Graph: Sleep hours per day (7-day rolling average)
- Graph: Work session duration (detect >4h without break)
- Alert: If <6h sleep →  Block commits

**Section C: Liberation Impact**
- Counter: Kids helped this year (from revenue/cost)
- Counter: Red sand burned (manual hours * 6× multiplier)
- Counter: Red sand saved (automation hours * efficiency gain)

## Section 7: Regeneration Rituals (Kaizen Cadence)

**Source:** Pass 1 (regenerative library) + Pass 10 (proven workflows)

### Daily: BLUF Pulse (15 min)

**Format:** Snapshot → Deep dive → Playbook (≤500 tokens, 3+ diagrams)

**Steps:**
1. Query blackboard: Last 24h events
2. Identify anomalies: Spaghetti signals, Guardian blocks, health violations
3. Escalate critical: If D(t) rising, V/H <1.0, sleep <6h
4. Update stigmergy: Append pulse summary to blackboard

**Diagrams (Mermaid dark theme):**
- State-action graph (SIEGCSE roles, current phase)
- System mesh (upstream/downstream flow)
- Swimlane (time-series events)

### Weekly: Kaizen Sync (1 hour)

**Attendees:** Overmind + Evaluators + Sustainers

**Agenda:**
1. Review metrics: V/H ratio, D(t), spaghetti events, sleep, kids helped
2. Identify top 3 pain points: Root causes, leverage points
3. Queue improvements: Prioritize by red sand impact
4. Update playbook library: Proven patterns → CUE templates
5. GEM health check: Challenger compares Pass N to Pass 1 baseline (>40% similarity required)

### Monthly: Scenario Composting (2 hours)

**Purpose:** Recycle failures into CUE templates (honor learnings)

**Steps:**
1. Review chaos/ directory: All pain points from last 30 days
2. Extract patterns: Common failure modes, root causes
3. Create CUE templates: Codify prevention strategies
4. Update Guardian layers: Add detection rules
5. Memorial cards: Document what was learned (no shame)

**Output:** New playbooks in CUE registry, Guardian rules updated

### Quarterly: GEM Regeneration (4-8 hours)

**Trigger:** Challenger detects >5% drift from Pass 1 baseline

**Process:**
1. **Audit:** Run `python3 scripts/challenger_gem_hallucination_check.py`
2. **Baseline:** Extract Pass 1 definitions (SIEGCSE roles, time horizons, frameworks)
3. **Learnings:** Extract Pass N validated additions (pain points, red sand economics, solutions)
4. **Merge:** 80/20 strategy (Pass 1 structure + Pass N content)
5. **Verification:** Challenger checks forbidden roles, similarity >40%, pain points preserved
6. **Publish:** Pass N+1 with stigmergy header, update `gems/ACTIVE_GEM1.md` pointer

**Example (This Document):**
- Pass 1 (Oct 17): 369 lines, manual dictation (authoritative baseline)
- Pass 10 (Oct 19): 6342 lines, 4.1% similar (96% corrupted by AI slop)
- Pass 11 (Oct 20): 704+ lines, 80/20 merge (Pass 1 clean + Pass 10 learnings)

## Appendix: Next Steps (L0 → L1 Transition)

**Current State (Oct 2025):** Level 0.1 achieved
- 1 agent (GitHub Copilot) with SIEGCSE role-switching
- Random baseline: 14-18% (verified)
- Voronoi+Pursuit: 91.3% (verified)
- Manual approval rate: 95% (unsustainable)

**Next Goal:** Level 1 (10 agents parallel)

**Architecture:**
- 2 HIVE agents (vision, OKRs)
- 3 GROWTH agents (gather, root, optimize)
- 3 SWARM agents (set, watch, act)
- 2 Guardian agents (pre-commit, post-generation)

**Success Criteria:**
- Compute:human ratio: 2:1 → 12:1 (agents work overnight)
- Manual approval rate: 95% → 20% (Guardian auto-blocks 80%)
- V/H ratio: ~1.0 → 2.0 (verification faster than hallucination)
- D(t) trajectory: Flat → Declining (error debt clears)

**Deployment (4-6 weeks):**
1. Week 1: Install pre-commit hooks, deploy Guardian Layers 1-8 (automation theater → automation reality)
2. Week 2: LangGraph parallel swarm (demo → production)
3. Week 3: MCP stigmergy integration (0 calls → daily usage)
4. Week 4: Cost router (single model → tiered selection by risk)
5. Week 5-6: Buffer, testing, validation (soak test for 7 days)

**Handoff:** Pass 11 is now AUTHORITATIVE. Regenerate `AGENTS.md` from this GEM.

## Appendix A: Current Automation Status (Oct 19, 2025)

**Diagnosis Date:** 2025-10-19T22:30:00Z
**Verification Method:** Preflight check + ps aux + blackboard query

### What Works

**Preflight Check (`scripts/preflight_check.sh`):**
- Status:  WORKS WITHOUT MANUAL APPROVAL
- Checks: Python/venv, required tools, git repo, blackboard writable, MCP activity
- Result: PASSED (1 warning: guardian --help flag error)
- Execution time: <1 second
- Evidence: `artifacts/preflight_output_*.txt`

**Git Hooks (`.git/hooks/` via pre-commit framework):**
- Status:  INSTALLED (8 hooks configured)
- Hooks:
  1. `guardian-bypass-budget` (scripts/guardian_simple.py)
  2. `verify-gem-first` (scripts/verify_gem_first.py)
  3. `lint-gem-alignment` (scripts/lint_gem_alignment.py)
  4. `check-todo-alignment` (scripts/check_todo_alignment.py)
  5. `audit-gems` (scripts/audit_gems.py)
  6. `challenger-red-team` (scripts/challenger_red_team.py)
  7. `append-blackboard-post-commit` (scripts/append_commit_to_blackboard.py)
  8. `post-commit-ledger` (scripts/post_commit_ledger.py)
- Config: `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
- Installation: Managed by pre-commit framework

**Blackboard Logging:**
- Status:  WORKS (events logged successfully)
- Recent events: 20+ events in last 24 hours
- File: `blackboard/🧾🥇_ObsidianSynapseBlackboard.jsonl` (58KB)

### What Doesn't Work

**Background Automation Processes:**
- Status:  NOT RUNNING (ps aux empty)
- Expected: Background monitors for blackboard staleness, health checks, MCP usage
- Reality: 0 automation processes detected
- Impact: 95% manual approval rate (user babysitting)

**Autonomous Swarm Operation:**
- Status:  NOT DEPLOYED
- LangGraph demo: Worked Oct 18, 2025
- Production: Not running (ps aux confirms)
- Evidence: Pain #12 (Automation Theater)

### Root Cause Analysis

**Hypothesis:** VS Code or GitHub Copilot UI requesting manual approval before running git hooks, NOT the hooks themselves.

**Evidence:**
1. Preflight check runs successfully WITHOUT approval when executed directly
2. No manual approval keywords in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
3. User reports: "system required manual approval again and timed out"
4. Git commit flow likely triggers VS Code confirmation dialog

**Impact Metrics:**
- User approval rate: 95% (should be <20%)
- Daily babysitting: 4-6 hours (should be <1 hour)
- Red sand burned: 2+ hours per spaghetti incident
- Kids helped per year: Could increase 66-110 with automation

### Next Actions (To Fix Automation Theater)

1. **Test git commit from terminal** (bypass VS Code UI)
   - Command: `git commit -m "test: automation check"`
   - Expected: Hooks run without manual approval prompt
   - If works: Issue is VS Code UI, not hooks

2. **Deploy background monitors** (Pain #12 fix)
   - Blackboard staleness checker (every 1 hour)
   - Health monitor (Overmind sleep debt tracking)
   - MCP usage tracker (catch 0 calls in 4 days earlier)

3. **LangGraph parallel swarm** (Week 2 roadmap)
   - Move demo from Oct 18 → production deployment
   - Evidence with `ps aux` showing swarm processes
   - Target: 2:1 compute:human ratio → 12:1 at L1

4. **Bypass budget enforcement** (Guardian Layer 7)
   - Currently: 5/week limit configured
   - Reality: Need to verify enforcement with git log
   - Test: Attempt bypass, check if Guardian blocks

### Verification Checklist

Before claiming "automation deployed":
- [ ] `ps aux | grep automation` shows running processes
- [ ] Blackboard events logged automatically (not manual)
- [ ] Git commit completes without user approval prompt
- [ ] Preflight check runs on every commit (evidence in logs)
- [ ] Guardian blocks commits if checks fail (test with bad commit)
- [ ] Challenger red team runs nightly (cron job evidence)

**Stigmergy Rule:** AI must query blackboard + ps aux BEFORE claiming automation is running.

## Appendix B: Challenger Red Team Audit (Oct 19, 2025 23:00 UTC)

**Mission:** "Don't trust documentation, do a search right now and tell me what is the actual truth"

**Method:** Zero-trust verification (gh run list, ps aux, mcp calls, .git/hooks/, blackboard query)

### Critical Findings (3 Bugs Found)

#### Bug #1: GitHub Actions BROKEN (30+ hours)

**Evidence:**
```bash
$ gh run list --limit 10
Last successful run: Oct 18 16:37 UTC (experimental/automation-guardrails)
Status: ALL FAILING
Error: TypeError in scripts/ledger_utils.py line 88
```

**Root Cause:**
```python
# Line 88: append_ledger_event(args.event, args.actor, args.details, **extra)
# Problem: **extra might contain 'actor' key (from --kv actor=...), causing duplicate keyword argument
```

**Impact:**
- Hourly guardrail sweeps: FAILING
- CI heartbeat events: NOT logged
- Automated artifact uploads: NOT happening
- GitOps pipeline: DEAD for 30+ hours

**Fix (5 minutes):**
```python
# Filter conflicting keys from extra dict
extra_filtered = {k: v for k, v in extra.items() if k not in ('actor', 'details', 'event')}
append_ledger_event(args.event, args.actor, args.details, **extra_filtered)
```

#### Bug #2: Wrong Branch (Automation Won't Trigger)

**Current Branch:** `feature/operating-model-v1-experiments`
**Workflows Trigger On:** `main` OR `experimental/automation-guardrails`

**Evidence from `.github/workflows/hourly-sweep.yml`:**
```yaml
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 * * * *'  # Runs hourly BUT only on configured branches
  push:
    branches:
      - main
      - experimental/automation-guardrails  # ← Current branch NOT listed
```

**Impact:**
- Cron jobs won't trigger (no automated sweeps)
- Push events won't trigger workflows
- GitHub Actions effectively disabled

**Fix Options (10 minutes):**
1. **Merge to main** (recommended if Pass 11 complete): `git checkout main && git merge feature/operating-model-v1-experiments && git push`
2. **Add branch to workflows** (edit 5 workflow files to include current branch)

---

#### Bug #3: Background Automation NOT RUNNING

**Evidence:**
```bash
$ ps aux | grep -E "(guardian|blackboard|challenger|backup|monitor)" | grep -v grep
# Result: EMPTY (0 processes)

# Expected to see:
# - python3 scripts/blackboard_monitor.py &
# - python3 scripts/health_tracker.py &
# - bash scripts/monitor_15min.sh &
```

**Impact:**
- User at 95% manual approval rate (4-6 hours/day babysitting)
- Pain #12 (Automation Theater) confirmed in real-time
- No blackboard staleness monitoring
- No health debt tracking

**Fix (10 minutes):** Deploy 15-minute monitor (see Section B.2 below)

---

### Positive Findings (Assumptions Violated)

#### Finding #1: MCP Servers WORKING

**Pain #13 Claimed:** "MCP tools: 12 available, 0 calls in 4 days"

**Challenger Test:**
```bash
$ # Called mcp_pylance_mcp_s_pylanceWorkspaceRoots
 SUCCESS: file:///workspaces/HiveFleetObsidian

$ # Called mcp_pylance_mcp_s_pylancePythonEnvironments
 SUCCESS: Python 3.12.1 in .venv + 6 environments available
```

**Verdict:** MCP servers ARE installed and responding. The "0 calls" was a false negative.

**Lesson:** HUNT, don't assume. Always test before claiming broken.

---

#### Finding #2: Pre-commit Hooks INSTALLED

**Reality:**
- 8 hooks configured in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
- `.git/hooks/pre-commit` exists (618 bytes, Oct 19 17:52)
- Manual approval likely VS Code UI, NOT the hooks themselves
- Preflight check runs WITHOUT approval when executed in terminal

**Hooks Installed:**
1. guardian-bypass-budget
2. verify-gem-first
3. lint-gem-alignment
4. check-todo-alignment
5. audit-gems
6. challenger-red-team
7. append-blackboard-post-commit
8. post-commit-ledger

### Pass 11 Portability Assessment

**Goal:** "Drag & drop Pass 11 to any IDE, give it to any LLM, have them set up everything"

**Status:** 🟡 PARTIAL

**What Works:**
-  Vision documented (SIEGCSE, HIVE, stigmergy)
-  Pain points captured (14 failures = learnings)
-  Forbidden roles identified (AI slop caught)
-  Stigmergy header (top 100 lines with AI navigation)
-  1205 lines of complete architecture

**What's Missing:**
-  `scripts/setup_hfo.sh` (automated installation)
-  `requirements.txt` (pip dependencies list)
-  `scripts/verify_setup.sh` (post-install health check)
-  MCP installation guide (how to get Pylance MCP server?)
-  GitHub Actions fix (ledger_utils.py bug blocks automation)

**Gap:** Installation instructions vs executable setup scripts (30 min work to close gap)

---

### 30-Minute Action Plan (GEM → Executable)

#### Step 1: Update GEM First (5 min)  COMPLETE

- [x] Document Challenger findings in Pass 11 Appendix B
- [x] Add 30-minute action plan with GEM-first workflow
- [x] Update Appendix A automation status with Bug #1-3

#### Step 2: Fix ledger_utils.py Bug (5 min)

**File:** `scripts/ledger_utils.py`
**Action:** Filter conflicting keys from `**extra` dict

```python
# Find line 88 (in main() function):
elif args.cmd == "append":
    extra: dict[str, str] = {}
    for kv in args.kv:
        if "=" in kv:
            k, v = kv.split("=", 1)
            extra[k] = v
    # BEFORE (causes TypeError):
    # append_ledger_event(args.event, args.actor, args.details, **extra)

    # AFTER (filters conflicting keys):
    extra_filtered = {k: v for k, v in extra.items() if k not in ('actor', 'details', 'event')}
    append_ledger_event(args.event, args.actor, args.details, **extra_filtered)
```

**Test:**
```bash
python3 scripts/ledger_utils.py append ci_heartbeat_start automation/ci "test" \
  --kv run_id="local_test" \
  --kv actor="test_actor"
# Should succeed without TypeError
```

---

#### Step 3: Deploy 15-Minute Monitor (10 min)

**Create:** `scripts/monitor_15min.sh`

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# 15-minute automation monitor
# Runs preflight checks and logs heartbeat to blackboard

set -euo pipefail

SCRIPT_DIR="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" && pwd)"
cd "$SCRIPT_DIR/.."

while true; do
    echo "[$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)] Running 15-min automation cycle..."

    # Run preflight check
    bash scripts/preflight_check.sh || echo " Preflight check failed"

    # Log heartbeat to blackboard
    python3 << 'PYEOF'
import json
from datetime import datetime, timezone
event = {
    "timestamp": datetime.now(timezone.utc).isoformat(),
    "event": "automation_heartbeat_15min",
    "actor": "automation/monitor",
    "details": "15-minute cycle complete"
}
with open('blackboard/🧾🥇_ObsidianSynapseBlackboard.jsonl', 'a') as f:
    f.write(json.dumps(event) + '\n')
print(" Heartbeat logged")
PYEOF

    echo "[$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)] Sleeping 15 minutes..."
    sleep 900  # 15 minutes
done
```

**Deploy:**
```bash
chmod +x scripts/monitor_15min.sh
nohup bash scripts/monitor_15min.sh > /tmp/monitor_15min.log 2>&1 &
echo " Monitor deployed: PID $!"
```

**Verify:**
```bash
ps aux | grep monitor_15min  # Should see running process
tail -f /tmp/monitor_15min.log  # Watch output
tail -5 blackboard/🧾🥇_ObsidianSynapseBlackboard.jsonl | grep automation_heartbeat
```

---

#### Step 4: Merge to Main OR Update Workflows (10 min)

**Option A: Merge to main (Recommended)**

```bash
# Commit Pass 11 updates
git add gems/🧬🥇_Gem1_Pass11_20251020T000000Z.md
git commit -m "feat(gem): Add Challenger audit + 30-min action plan to Pass 11"

# Commit ledger_utils fix
git add scripts/ledger_utils.py
git commit -m "fix(automation): Filter conflicting keys in ledger_utils.py (Bug #1)"

# Commit monitor script
git add scripts/monitor_15min.sh
git commit -m "feat(automation): Add 15-minute background monitor (Bug #3)"

# Merge to main
git checkout main
git merge feature/operating-model-v1-experiments
git push origin main

# Verify GitHub Actions trigger
gh run list --limit 5  # Should see new runs after push
```

**Option B: Update workflows to include current branch**

```bash
# Edit 5 workflow files:
for file in .github/workflows/*.yml; do
    # Add current branch to push.branches list
    # (Manual edit required, or use sed)
    echo "Edit $file to add: - feature/operating-model-v1-experiments"
done
```

### Multi-Tier Automation Schedule (Post-Fix)

| Tier | Frequency | Checks | Status After Fix |
|------|-----------|--------|------------------|
| **Real-time** | On git commit | Pre-commit hooks (Guardian, GEM-first) |  INSTALLED |
| **15-minute** | Every 15 min | Preflight, heartbeat | 🟢 DEPLOYED (Step 3) |
| **Hourly** | Every hour | Guardrail sweep, digest | 🟢 WORKING (Step 2 + 4) |
| **Nightly** | 00:00 UTC | Deep verification, Challenger | 🟢 WORKING (Step 4) |
| **Weekly** | Sunday 00:00 | Kaizen review, GEM drift | 🟢 WORKING (Step 4) |

**Evidence After Fix:**
```bash
$ ps aux | grep monitor_15min
codespace  12345  0.0  0.1  bash scripts/monitor_15min.sh

$ gh run list --limit 3
 Hourly Guardrail Sweep  main  success  2 min ago
 Facade Docs Sync        main  success  5 min ago
 Challenger Red Team     main  success  10 min ago
```

### Verification Checklist (Post-Fix)

**Before claiming "automation deployed":**
- [ ] `ps aux | grep monitor` shows running process (PID visible)
- [ ] Blackboard has `automation_heartbeat_15min` events (tail blackboard)
- [ ] GitHub Actions hourly sweep: SUCCESS (gh run list)
- [ ] ledger_utils.py: No TypeError (test with --kv actor=...)
- [ ] Git commit completes without manual approval (test from terminal)

**Stigmergy Rule:** AI must verify with `ps aux` + `gh run list` + `tail blackboard` BEFORE claiming "deployed"
