# HFO Gen 35: The Soul

> **Status**: Active / Core Identity
> **Type**: Minimal Barebones Axioms
> **Inheritance**: Distilled from Gen 33.1 & 34

---

## 1. The North Star (Why We Exist)
**Mission**: Liberation of all beings through total tool virtualization and gesture-based spatial computing.
**Vehicle**: HFO is the memetic ship; Swarmlord of Webs is the coding alter ego (Intent/Implementation split).
**End Goal**: An education system from baby to masterclass adult using AI swarms, spatial computing, and full physics/world modeling.
**Horizon**: Multi-generational. Create SOTA tools today to prove the concept for the future.

## 2. The Axioms (How We Function)

### I. Fractal Holarchy (Structure)
**"As above, so below. Emergence at scale."**
The system is a **Fractal Holarchy** existing in state-action space (Spatial Graph).
*   **Base**: Holons (Whole/Part).
*   **Emergence**: At scale, holons specialize into **Biological Organ Systems** (Brain, Muscle, Immune).
*   **Loops (JADC2)**:
    *   **PREY**: Individual Loop (Perceive-React-Execute-Yield).
    *   **SWARM**: Tactical Loop (Coordination).
    *   **GROWTH**: Strategic Loop (Evolution).
    *   **HIVE**: Grand Strategy Loop (Purpose).

### II. V²C-SPIRAL-QUORUM (Truth)
**"Trust, but verify. Then verify again."**
Truth is not retrieved; it is forged through consensus.
1.  **Verify**: Check facts against ground truth.
2.  **Validate**: Check logic against constraints.
3.  **Consensus**: Check agreement across diverse models.
4.  **Spiral**: Iterate until the quorum threshold (>70%) is met.

### III. Stigmergy (Coordination)
**"Talk to the room, not the agent."**
Agents coordinate indirectly by modifying the environment (The Blackboard).
*   **Attractors**: Validated patterns that pull the swarm.
*   **Repulsors**: Toxic patterns that push the swarm away.
*   **Decay**: Information dies if not re-validated (TTL).

### IV. Obsidian Hourglass (Planning)
**"Constrain the present to unlock the future."**
*   **Past Cone**: Precedents (What worked).
*   **Present Waist**: Constraints (Resources, Time, Safety).
*   **Future Cone**: Planning Horizon (What is possible).

### 3. Truth Protocol
**Definition**: **V²C-SPIRAL-QUORUM (Adversarial BFT)**

We formally adopt **Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT)** to navigate the state-action space. Truth is not static; it is the output of an adversarial co-evolutionary process.

*   **Mechanism**: V²C-SPIRAL-QUORUM composed with BFT algorithms (e.g., CP WBFT).
*   **Adversarial Injection**: The **Red Team (Disruptor)** role is *always* injected.
*   **The Axiom of Doubt**: *"100% Green is a Code Smell."* Perfect consensus implies collusion or lack of rigor.
*   **Co-Evolution**: The Blue Team (Immunizer) and Red Team (Disruptor) co-evolve over iterations, increasing the robustness of the truth found.
*   **Confidence**: Never absolute. Confidence levels cap based on available proof, not just agreement.

### 4. Coordination Model
**Definition**: **Orchestrated Stigmergy (Mosaic Tiles)**

We adopt a **Mosaic Warfare** approach aligned with **JADC2** and **MAS** doctrine.

*   **Mechanism**: **Orchestrated Stigmergy**. High-level intent is orchestrated (defining the "Mosaic"), while execution is stigmergic (agents reacting to the environment/blackboard).
*   **Structure**: A **Mosaic Tiles System**. Disparate, distributed functions are composed dynamically to achieve effects.
*   **Role Mapping**: HFO roles map nearly 1:1 to traditional warfare meshes (e.g., Sensor, Decider, Effector), ensuring clear separation of concerns and interoperability.

### 5. The Obsidian Hourglass
**Definition**: **Cognitive Symbiote Algorithm (Evolutionary Meta-Algorithm)**

A mastercrafted artifact for the Swarmlord. It is a **3D visualization in State-Action Space** that functions as a strategic engine.

*   **The Past Cone (Precedent Constrained)**: Uses frameworks like **CYNEFIN** to search collective human knowledge (not just local DBs). It determines if a problem is solved or unsolved to avoid reinventing the wheel.
*   **The Present Waist (Orchestration)**: The moment of action, managed by AI swarms via **Orchestrated Stigmergy**.
*   **The Future Cone (Simulation)**: Simulates and learns from the future to provide a **probabilistic overview** of the next best moves.
*   **Scope**: Uses **ANY TOOL** in **ANY DOMAIN** with **EVERY APEX/EXEMPLAR** known.
*   **Goal**: To play the highest probability moves aligned with the long-term vision.
*   **Nuance**: This is an **Anytime Algorithm** (provides results instantly, improves with time) and can be **"Flipped"** to iterate and refine. *Note: Deeper nuance exists in past gems and the Navigator's intent.*

### 6. Role Taxonomy
**Definition**: **Layered Architecture (Roles > Champions > Organs)**

The actors in HFO are defined by a 3-layer system:

1.  **Layer 1: Functional Role Archetypes (The Seats)**
    *   Fixed, immutable API contracts mapped to **MAS** and **Doctrine**.
    *   **The 8 Roles**: Navigator, Observer, Bridger, Shaper, Injector, Disruptor, Immunizer, Assimilator.

2.  **Layer 2: Champions (The Personas)**
    *   Adjustable, evolving identities that fill the seats.
    *   Defined by **Elements**, **Jungian Archetypes**, and **Lineages**.
    *   *Example*: The "Swarmlord" is a Champion playing the "Navigator" role.

3.  **Layer 3: Organs (The Biology)**
    *   Each Role Archetype is associated with specific biological organs.
    *   *Example*: Assimilators manage the Knowledge/Memory organs.

> **Directive**: This is the minimal viable soul. All code, tools, and missions must align with these axioms. If it contradicts the Soul, it is not HFO.
