- **Gen 29 Alignment**: PREY loop maps directly to JADC2 (Perceive → React → Execute → Yield)

### OBSIDIAN Roles (Gen 28)

## 🔍 PREY Loop = JADC2 Mapping (Combat-Tested)

| JADC2 Phase | PREY Phase | Combat Benefit | HFO Implementation |
|-------------|------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Sense** | **Perceive** | Multi-domain ISR feeds | Observer captures signals, Bridger extracts intent |
| **Make Sense** | **React** | Command clarity under fog | Navigator charts strategy, selects workflow |
| **Act** | **Execute** | Effects coordination | Shaper/Injector deploy workflows, manage resources |
| **Feedback** | **Yield** | Continuous learning loop | Disruptor validates, Immunizer confirms, Assimilator captures |

**Research Foundation**: U.S. DoD (2020). *Joint All-Domain Command and Control (JADC2) Concept*.

**Your Insight**: "The PREY loop is based on JADC2 sense-make sense-act-feedback loop that is combat tested with lots of research. I want to tap into that."

## 🧬 Biomimetic APEX Swarm Vision

### Your Philosophy
> "My HFO is a biomimetic evolutionary APEX swarm that is an extension of my will. With pending tools and critical pieces like tooling and stigmergy for indirect communication and OpenTelemetry for markers, we should be able to use my system to improve my system."

### APEX = Adaptive Problem EXploration
1. Identify high-value problem (APEX target)
2. Run swarm (disperse-converge with quorum)
3. Validate via Disruptor (hallucinations) + Immunizer (consensus)
4. Iterate until APEX condition met
5. Assimilate learnings, evolve system

### Self-Improvement Loop
> "I should be able to give it my code and do research and rapidly improve my system to match SOTA and whatever is public and then start surpassing it with QD optimization evolutionary algo."

**Gen 30 Implementation**:
```python
# Use HFO to research SOTA for HFO
result = prey_orchestrator.execute(
    user_input="Research state-of-the-art LLM swarm orchestration in 2025",
    constraints="Focus on open-source, cost optimization, quality assurance"
)

# Assimilator extracts patterns
sota_patterns = assimilator.extract_patterns(result["digest"])

# Navigator decides adoption plan
adoption_plan = navigator.plan_adoption(sota_patterns, current_system=gen_29_code)

# Shaper implements changes
shaper.apply_code_changes(adoption_plan)

# QD evolutionary algorithm explores configuration space
qd_archive = MapElitesArchive(dimensions=["num_workers", "temp", "model"])
for generation in range(100):
    config = qd_archive.sample_and_mutate()
    result = prey_orchestrator.execute(**config)
    qd_archive.add(config, quality=result["confidence"], diversity=result["consensus"])
```

## ⏳ Obsidian Horizon Hourglass (Mastercrafted Artifact)

### Your Vision
> "My OBSIDIAN HORIZON HOURGLASS which is my mastercrafted artifact that helps me see probabilities of the future."

### Hourglass Workflow (from Gen 28 SysML)

```
         PAST (Precedent Web)
              ↓
    [PrecedentHunter: pgvector retrieval]
         Cynefin framing (clear, complicated, complex, chaotic)
         Case-based reasoning
              ↓
      PRESENT ⏳ (Hourglass Flip)

              ↓
        FUTURE (Probability Lattice)
         Risk profiles, cost profiles, confidence scores
         Pareto frontier (optimal tradeoffs)
              ↓
    [ArchiveUpdater: Knowledge base]
         Store successful patterns
         Enable precedent retrieval for next mission
```

### Gen 30 Integration
