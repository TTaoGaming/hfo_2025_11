# Gen26 TODO (2025-11-07T00:00:00Z)

BLUF
You already have the Gen26 SSOT markdown and SysML mirror in place. To work directly in official SysML tooling without drift, finish the official validation workflow and then bring the live services (pgvector → NATS → Temporal) online so the SysML model matches reality. Only after those unlocks should SBOM, FinOps, and scaling tasks proceed.

Status note — 2025-11-08
- Java 17 is present; official SysML v2 Pilot JAR is not yet configured. The “SysML v2: Validate (official)” task currently exits with code 2 due to missing `SYSML_V2_PILOT_JAR`. Proceed with Item 1.

## Legend
- [ ] pending
- [~] in progress
- [x] done
- (A) Acceptance criteria inline

## Today’s Critical Unlocks (do in order)
1. [ ] SysML v2 Official Validation & Views
   - Steps: install Java 17+ → download SysML v2 Pilot JAR → `export SYSML_V2_PILOT_JAR=/abs/path/to/pilot.jar` → validate `sysml/hfo_gen26.sysml` via task or script → (optional) open in SysIDE for official diagrams. Mermaid is convenience-only; SysML file is SSOT.
   - Status today: Java 17 OK; JAR not set; task exit=2. After setting `SYSML_V2_PILOT_JAR`, expect official PASS/FAIL output under `temp/mbse/`.
   - (A) `temp/mbse/sysml_validation_report.txt` present and shows PASS; VS Code task “SysML v2: Validate (official)” runs; `scripts/mbse/README_sysmlv2_official.md` exists and reflects steps.
2. [ ] pgvector DB Online & Baseline Ingest
   - Steps: compose up → export PG* env → healthcheck PASS → ingest repo → hybrid query returns results.
   - (A) healthcheck status PASS, row_count > 0, ingest span shows added>0.
3. [ ] NATS JetStream Provisioning
   - Steps: add ops/nats/docker-compose.yml → add nats-py dep → implement async `send_nats_event` → receipt logging.
   - (A) publish ACK, stream `agent.events` visible, consumer lag metric spans.
4. [ ] Temporal Worker Activation (Feature Flag)
   - Steps: add temporalio → worker file `temporal_worker.py` guarded by HFO_ENABLE_TEMPORAL → register ingest_delta + healthcheck_vector_db + generate_digest.
   - (A) run completes activities; spans name `temporal:activity:*`; receipt with mission_id and evidence_refs.

## Secondary Guardrails (stabilize after unlocks)
5. [ ] SBOM & SLSA Provenance
   - Steps: add cyclonedx lib → script `scripts/ci/generate_sbom.py` → emit `reports/sbom.cdx.json` + provenance receipt (hash summary).
   - (A) sbom file present; receipt evidence_refs include sbom path + hash lines.
6. [ ] FinOps Meter
   - Steps: create `scripts/crew_ai/finops_meter.py` → capture token usage, vector storage (row_count*dims), NATS throughput → integrate into digest.
   - (A) digest has `## FinOps` section with token_cost_usd estimate and storage_mb.
7. [ ] CI Drift & Health Gates
   - Steps: add workflow running md_to_sysml + healthcheck + sbom generation; fail on mismatch.
   - (A) PR shows PASS for drift, healthcheck, sbom.
8. [ ] OpenFeature Central Client
   - Steps: integrate SDK → map env flags to dynamic flags → receipts log evaluated flag set.
   - (A) engage_report.yml lists feature_flags_evaluated.
9. [ ] SSOT YAML Model (`models/hfo_gen26.yml`)
   - Steps: create YAML with blocks, interfaces, allocations; add generator placeholder.
   - (A) YAML validated (no placeholders), referenced by README Tags.
10. [ ] BlackBoard Single-Writer Optimization
    - Steps: introduce queue writer for >25 lanes to prevent contention.
    - (A) stress run shows no write conflicts; receipts monotonic.

## Later / Nice-to-Have
11. [ ] Concurrency Scaling to 40 Lanes Canary
    - Steps: mission intent with lanes.max_workers=40 + stagger; run stress + trace analysis.
    - (A) spans show parallelism; quorum_plus PASS; p95 latency acceptable (<2x baseline).
12. [ ] Stigmergy Bias in Lane Selection
    - Steps: integrate signals into lane planning; react_plan.yml includes applied bias; test with recruit signals.
    - (A) react_plan includes stigmergy_bias array; higher signal topics favored.
13. [ ] MAP-Elites Gameforge Scaffold
    - Steps: genome schema doc → evaluation script → initial diversity archive table → receipt.
    - (A) run produces at least 3 genomes evaluated and archive summary JSON.
14. [ ] Digest Metrics Enhancement (speedup, cost per lane)
15. [ ] Diagram Auto-Generation (scripts/mbse/gen_views.py placeholder)
16. [ ] Knowledge Layer Full BM25 Persistence
17. [ ] Temporal Activity for Genome Evolution (evaluate_genome)
18. [ ] NATS Event Replay & Consumer Lag Dashboard

## Completed (Today)
- [x] Gen26 SSOT README + SysML mirror
- [x] Gap analysis (pgvector FAIL state documented)
- [x] Evolution document (Gen1–25 + mission intents)
- [x] Temporal activities scaffold (stubs + spans)
- [x] Initial context diagram (Gen26)
- [x] SysML v2 official tooling scaffold (validation script + README + VS Code task)

## Blockers / Risks
| Item | Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------|------------|
| pgvector offline | No memory retrieval | Compose up + healthcheck gating |
| NATS missing | No event bus | Provision JetStream early (small config) |
| Temporal absent | No 24/7 orchestration | Feature-flag worker incremental rollout |
| SBOM/SLSA absent | Supply chain opacity | Add CycloneDX + provenance receipts |
| Cost visibility | Budget surprises | FinOps meter; token & storage estimates |

## Sequencing Recommendation
0. SysML v2 official validation → 1. pgvector → 2. NATS → 3. Temporal → 4. SBOM/SLSA → 5. FinOps → 6. Concurrency/Stigmergy → 7. MAP-Elites scaffold → 8. OpenFeature → 9. SSOT YAML → 10. CI gates.

## Receipt Plan
Each completed item appends a blackboard receipt with phase=engage or verify and evidence_refs: [file paths, line ranges, span file].

## Exit Criteria for "Gen26 Base Ready"
- Items 1–5 PASS acceptance.
- Gap analysis updated to reflect PASS states.
- Digest includes FinOps + Stigmergy bias section.
- Healthcheck PASS and at least one successful Temporal run receipt.

## MBSE/SysML v2 — One-Screen How-To

- Validate (headless)
   ```bash
   bash scripts/mbse/validate_sysml_official.sh sysml/hfo_gen26.sysml
   ```
- VS Code task
   - Command Palette → Run Task → “SysML v2: Validate (official)”
- Interactive (optional)
   - Install SysIDE, open `sysml/hfo_gen26.sysml`, render official diagrams

Notes
- SSOT is `sysml/hfo_gen26.sysml`.
- Mermaid diagrams are convenience-only for quick checks; official validation is the correctness gate.
