# User Dictation – Scatter-Gather & Fractal Scaling Vision

**Session**: 2025-11-14 21:20 MST
**Context**: Post-successful balanced-10 multi-model execution (run_210809)
**Topic**: Generation 31 initialization, scatter-gather formalization

## 💬 User Quotes (Raw Dictation)

### Quote 1: Generation 31 Intent

> "what I want you to do is to help me generate HFO GEM generation 31 with this successful pattern. I think it's called scatter gather and we need to prioritize tools and stigmergy enabling to let the swarm be more effective. I think we can scale fractally really fast if we need to as well. I should try to push the limit soon after we document successful experiment. what I need is to start recording my quotes and messages to the ai"

**Timestamp**: 2025-11-14 21:20 MST
**Key Concepts**:
- "scatter gather" pattern formalization
- "prioritize tools and stigmergy enabling"
- "scale fractally really fast"
- "push the limit soon after we document"
- "start recording my quotes and messages"

**Intent Analysis**:
1. **Pattern Recognition**: User identified successful Gen 30 pattern as "scatter-gather"
2. **Tool Priority**: Emphasize tool effectiveness (read_file, grep, etc.)
3. **Stigmergy Urgency**: Need full NATS integration, not just connection
4. **Fractal Confidence**: Ready for rapid L1 → L2 → L3 scaling
5. **Knowledge Transfer**: Systematic capture of user dictation

**Decisions Made**:
- Create Generation 31 focusing on scatter-gather formalization
- Prioritize tool enhancements (summarization, graceful degradation)
- Wire stigmergy coordinator for active signal consumption
- Prepare for L2/L3 fractal scaling tests
- Implement user dictation capture system

## 🎯 Extracted Vision

### Scatter-Gather Pattern

**User's Mental Model**:
```
Scatter (Disperse):
  Intent → Orchestrator → N parallel researchers (tool-enabled)

Gather (Converge):
  N responses → Validator → Synthesizer → DIGEST
```

**Key Insight**: User sees this as the core pattern worth formalizing and scaling.

### Tool & Stigmergy Priority

**User's Expectation**:
- Tools make researchers "more effective" (can read codebase, not just guess)
- Stigmergy enables coordination (confidence signals, citation validation)
- Current state: Connected but not fully integrated
- Goal: Active consumption of signals for abort/retry decisions

### Fractal Scaling Readiness

**User's Confidence**:
- "scale fractally really fast if we need to"
- "push the limit soon after we document successful experiment"

**Interpretation**:
- Gen 30 validation (run_210809: 9/10 models, HIGH consensus, 45.5s) provides confidence
- Ready to scale from L1 (10) → L2 (100) → L3 (1000) rapidly
- Need to document success before pushing limits

### Knowledge Transfer Concern

**User's Need**:
- "start recording my quotes and messages to the ai"

**Why This Matters**:
- Previous sessions showed concept drift across generations
- User vision gets lost in AI implementation details
- Need systematic capture of intent, rationale, decisions

## 📊 Context (What Led Here)

### Successful Gen 30 Execution

**Mission**: run_210809_what_are_the_key_differences_between_temporal_work
**Metrics**:
- Duration: 45.5s
- Researchers: 10/10 completed (9 successful)
- Consensus: HIGH
- Models: 9 different architectures (balanced-10 roster)
- Cost: ~$0.01-0.02

**What Worked**:
- Multi-model diversity (scatter)
- Quorum consensus (gather)
- Tool access (read_file working)
- Smart timeouts (no auto-aborts)

**What's Missing** (User's Observation):
- Full stigmergy integration (signals not consumed)
- Tool effectiveness not maximized
- Fractal scaling not tested (L2/L3)

### Previous Context (From AGENTS.md)

**Gen 30 Achievement** (2025-11-12):
- V²C-SPIRAL-QUORUM formalized
- Multi-model roster validated
- Timeout brittleness fixed
- Production consolidation (124 files archived)

**User's Vision** (From earlier sessions):
- Fractal holonic architecture (L0 → L1 → L2 → L3)
- Stigmergy coordination (NATS signals)
- Recursive self-improvement (swarm researches codebase)
- SSOT-driven development (SysML v2 → auto-generate Python)

## 🔍 Key Decisions Captured

### Decision 1: Formalize Scatter-Gather

**Rationale**: User explicitly identified this as "the successful pattern"
**Action**: Create formal definition in Gen 31 intent
**Impact**: Provides vocabulary for AI assistants across sessions

### Decision 2: Prioritize Tools

**Rationale**: "need to prioritize tools... to let the swarm be more effective"
**Action**: Tool result summarization, graceful degradation, capability matrix
**Impact**: Prevents context explosion, handles model incompatibilities

### Decision 3: Enable Stigmergy

**Rationale**: "stigmergy enabling" alongside tools
**Action**: Wire coordinator to consume signals, make abort decisions
**Impact**: Active coordination vs passive monitoring

### Decision 4: Scale Fractally

**Rationale**: "scale fractally really fast if we need to"
**Action**: Prepare L2/L3 orchestrators, validate cost/performance
**Impact**: Ready for 100-1000 researcher missions

### Decision 5: Capture Dictation

**Rationale**: "start recording my quotes and messages to the ai"
**Action**: Create `user_dictation/` directory, timestamped captures
**Impact**: Preserve user intent across sessions/generations

## 🎓 Patterns Observed

### User Communication Style

1. **Concept-First**: Names patterns ("scatter gather") before implementation
2. **Pragmatic**: "after we document successful experiment"
3. **Urgent**: "soon", "really fast", "need to prioritize"
4. **Meta-Aware**: Recognizes need to record dictation

### User Expectations

1. **Rapid Iteration**: Document success → scale immediately
2. **Proven Patterns**: Build on Gen 30 success, don't rebuild
3. **Knowledge Preservation**: Concerned about AI forgetfulness
4. **Push Limits**: Ready to test boundaries after validation

## 📝 Follow-Up Questions (For Next Session)

1. **L2 Budget**: Comfortable with $0.02 per 100-researcher mission?
2. **L3 Timeline**: Test 1000 researchers this week or next?
3. **Tool Priority**: Summarization first or FREE tier compatibility?
4. **Stigmergy Urgency**: Block L2 test until coordinator wired?
5. **Dictation Format**: Prefer raw quotes or extracted concepts?
