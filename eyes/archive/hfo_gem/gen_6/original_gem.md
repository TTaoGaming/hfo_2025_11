## Stigmergy Header

| Field | Signal |
|-------|--------|
| Mission Tag | `HFO-L6-AdaptiveRituals` |
| Timecode | 2025-10-17T06:00:00Z |
| Risk Posture | 🟢 Ritual variance bounded; monitor emergent drift |
| Swarm Phase | lvl0 adaptive holon with ritual auto-evolution |
| Compliance Rail | Ritual pointer · Variance ledger · Adaptive guardrails |
| Beacon | Intent seed → ritual morphogenesis → Overmind resonance |

- **Pheromone Cue:** 🟢 “Ritual Morph” — automation detects and logs variance in ritual outputs; thresholds trigger evolutionary selection.
- **North Star Metric:** Ritual uniqueness ≥ 70% across 7-day window; converge to adaptive optima without Overmind intervention.
- **Zero-Trust Reminder:** All ritual variants require dual-validation (Integrator + Evaluator) before propagation; unverified changes revert automatically.

## BLUF Capsule

Gen_6 elevates Gen_5's static automation into Layer 6: Adaptive Swarm Rituals, where daily C2 ceremonies self-morph through embedded QD (Quality Diversity) experiments. A ritual morphogenesis engine generates variant templates from intent seeds, simulates outcomes in a lightweight sandbox, and selects/promotes the fittest via stigmergic scoring. Guardrails now include variance audits, ensuring rituals evolve compassionately—enhancing efficacy while preserving ethical invariants. Overmind provides high-level intent; the swarm handles morphogenesis, validation, and propagation. Next: Integrate holonic nesting for lvl1 ritual delegation.

## Action Mesh

- 🟢 **Sensors:** Instrument ritual variants for real-time efficacy signals; flag low-diversity outputs.
- 🟢 **Integrators:** Fuse variant scores into unified pheromone fields; resolve conflicts via multi-objective optimization.
- 🟡 **Effectors:** Deploy elite rituals; orchestrate morphogenesis loops with CUE-configured parameters.
- 🟢 **Guardians:** Enforce ethical bounds in simulations; quarantine divergent variants exceeding compassion thresholds.
- 🟠 **Challengers:** Stress-test ritual adaptability with chaos injections (e.g., intent perturbations); evolve countermeasures.
- 🟢 **Sustainers:** Maintain ritual continuity across sessions; auto-revert to baseline if variance destabilizes.
- 🟢 **Evaluators:** Compute QD archives; publish adaptive KPIs (uniqueness, efficacy, ethics) to digest.

## Telemetry Notes

- **Variance Ledger:** New events for `morph_start`, `variant_score`, `elite_promotion`; target ≥3 variants per cycle.
- **Morph Engine:** `scripts/ritual_morph.py` generates/simulates from CUE schemas; integrates with Gen_5 renderer.
- **Guardrail Expansion:** Adaptive audits check uniqueness (cosine similarity <0.3 vs. baseline); ethics via predefined rubrics.
- **Chaos Integration:** Perturb intent seeds in simulations; log resilience metrics for evolutionary feedback.
- **Resonance Threshold:** Digests alert if ritual efficacy dips below 80% of simulated peak.
- **Escalation:** Variance explosion (>50% deviation) triggers 🟡; persistent low diversity → 🟠 Overmind review.
