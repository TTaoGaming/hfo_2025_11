## 🧬 Biological Function
The **Memory** is the storehouse of **Wisdom**. It persists knowledge beyond the lifespan of a single agent. It uses a "Stigmergic GraphRAG" approach, combining fast episodic logs with slow, semantic knowledge graphs.

## 📂 Contents
*   `episodic/`: Raw logs, audit trails, and short-term history.
*   `semantic/`: Knowledge graphs, vector embeddings, and long-term insights.
*   `procedural/`: Codebases and learned patterns.

## 🤖 Agent Instructions
*   **Remember**: Log every action and result.
*   **Recall**: Query memory before acting to avoid repeating mistakes.
