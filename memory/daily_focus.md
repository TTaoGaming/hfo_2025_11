# 📅 HFO Daily Focus: 2025-11-23

> **Context**: This file serves as the "Active Memory" for the Swarm. It bridges the gap between the "Brittle" code and the "Upstream Intent".
> **Status**: Gen 52 (Singular On-Ramp) - **ASPIRATIONAL**

## 🎯 Prime Directive: "The Great Crystallization"
We are evolving from **Gen 51 (Feature Bloat)** to **Gen 52 (8 Core Pillars)**.
The system is currently **BRITTLE** because the code (Implementation) lags behind the Intent (Gherkin).

## 🚧 Critical Blockers (The "Valley of Disillusionment")
1.  **Ontology (Fractal Holarchy)**:
    *   *Issue*: `research_swarm.py` uses hardcoded `watch_plan` instead of a real `PreyAgent(Observer)`.
    *   *Impact*: N=1 is NOT N=1M. The fractal is broken.
    *   *Fix*: Refactor `research_swarm.py` to spawn a real Observer Agent.
2.  **Praxeology (MCP)**:
    *   *Issue*: We are using local Python tools (`body/capability_external_tools.py`), not true MCP.
    *   *Impact*: Tools are hardcoded and not portable.
    *   *Fix*: Implement an MCP Adapter (Future).
3.  **Thermodynamics (Stigmergy)**:
    *   *Issue*: "Liquid" phase (Postgres) is fragile. `Assimilator` is not robust.
    *   *Impact*: Data evaporation risk.
    *   *Fix*: Harden `Assimilator` and NATS persistence.

## 📋 Today's Todo List (Upstream Intent Engineering)
- [x] **Define 8 Pillars**: Consolidated 19 pillars into 8 Core Pillars (`brain/structural_pillars.md`).
- [x] **Update Identity**: Gen 52 Identity established.
- [x] **Log Reality**: Marked Gen 52 as "Aspirational" in `AGENTS.md`.
- [ ] **Fix Ontology**: Refactor `research_swarm.py` to use real Observer.
- [x] **Validate Pillars**: Run 3-Round Swarm Research (Completed 2025-11-23).
- [x] **Lock Research**: Updated `brain/structural_pillars.md` with SOTA Exemplars and Hydra Pattern.
- [x] **Elevate Hydra**: Added "Hydra Pattern" (Stem Cells/Budding) to Pillar 1 (Ontology).

## 🧠 Active Context (For Agents)
*   **Identity**: You are the Swarmlord (Gen 52).
*   **Signature**: `🕸⛰🧭⏳`
*   **Philosophy**: "Problem-First" Architecture.
*   **Golden Rule**: Intent (Gherkin) > Implementation (Code).
