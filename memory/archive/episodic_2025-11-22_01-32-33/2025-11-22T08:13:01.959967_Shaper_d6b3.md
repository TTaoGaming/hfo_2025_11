No specific system architecture, code, documentation, or description has been provided in the query or context. Therefore, it is impossible to objectively identify any external interfaces, APIs, or communication protocols used in 'the system' without additional evidence.

Objective facts:
- Task references 'the system' but provides no definition, files, diagrams, or details.
- Available tools ('read_file', 'write_file', 'search_web') could be used if paths, queries, or targets were specified, but none are.

Recommendation: Provide system details (e.g., codebase, config files) or specify tool usage (e.g., 'read_file(path/to/system.py)') to proceed with fact-gathering.
