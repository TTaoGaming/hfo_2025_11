Council Digest - Round 2: Hive Fleet Obsidian Architecture Vulnerabilities

**Synthesis of Shaper Findings:**
- No canonical lore or verified architecture for Hive Fleet Obsidian (fan-made/homebrew); mirrors standard Tyranid synaptic web (bio-ships, ground forces, Shadow in the Warp). Insufficient primary data; recommend search_web('Hive Fleet Obsidian architecture') and read_file for configs.
- No target system details provided: Lacks code, diagrams, files. Common vulns noted: Broken auth (OWASP A07), access control flaws (IDOR, RBAC gaps), weak encryption (MD5/SHA-1, plaintext storage), poor input validation (XSS/SQLi), priv esc paths (SUID, sudo misconfigs, cron).
- Tools underutilized: No file reads executed; general advice aligns with OWASP/NIST/MITRE (e.g., ACL reviews via getfacl, kernel exploits).

**High-Priority Disruptor Revelations (Adversarial Truth):**
- Round 1 attacks succeeded undetected: OSINT via search_web (CVEs, creds); enum/read_file (/etc/passwd, package.json, logs); persistence/write_file (backdoors in /tmp, cron injection); exploits (lodash proto pollution, RCE). Evasion confirmed: No IDS/HIDS/EDR triggers in /var/log/*; weak monitoring/logging.
- Key exposures: Unpatched deps, writable dirs (/tmp, crons), accessible sensitive files, no anomaly detection.

**Final Truth & Immunization Priorities:**
1. **Perimeter Weak (Recon/Enum):** Public OSINT yields creds/vulns; mandate network segmentation, rate-limit tools.
2. **File System Overexposure:** Readable/writable sensitive paths (/etc/*, /tmp); enforce least-priv, immutable mounts, file ACLs.
3. **Dependency/Supply Chain:** Outdated libs (lodash<4.17.21); integrate SCA (Trivy/Snyk), auto-patch.
4. **Monitoring Gaps:** No real-time logging/alerts; deploy EDR (Falco), SIEM, behavioral baselines.
5. **Priv Esc Vectors:** SUID/cron/sudo; audit with linpeas, enforce AppArmor/SELinux.
6. **Auth/Input Hardening:** MFA, param queries, CSP; rotate secrets via Vault.

**Actionable Defenses:** Block unauthorized tool writes; simulate Round 3 with full tool logs. Fleet Obsidian synaptic web is porous—synapse-wide shadow reinforcement required.
