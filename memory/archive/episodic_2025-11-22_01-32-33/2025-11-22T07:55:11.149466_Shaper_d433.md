Assessment of Error Handling, Exceptions, and Recovery Mechanisms:

1. **read_file Tool**:
   - Handles FileNotFoundError and PermissionError via try-except blocks.
   - Recovery: Logs error and returns None; retries once on transient IOErrors.
   - Strength: Graceful fallback; Weakness: No user notification on repeated failures.

2. **write_file Tool**:
   - Catches OSError and ValueError for invalid paths/content.
   - Recovery: Atomic writes using temp files; up to 3 retries with exponential backoff.
   - Strength: Data integrity preserved; Weakness: Fails silently if disk full without alert.

3. **search_web Tool**:
   - Manages requests.exceptions.Timeout, ConnectionError, and HTTPError (4xx/5xx).
   - Recovery: Automatic retry (max 2) with jitter; falls back to cached results if available.
   - Strength: Resilient to network flakes; Weakness: No proxy rotation for rate limits.

Overall: Solid coverage with retries and logging, but lacks centralized monitoring and user-configurable recovery thresholds. Recommend adding circuit breakers for production use.
