As a Shaper tasked with researching Hive Fleet Obsidian, I begin by gathering objective facts using available tools. Hive Fleet Obsidian does not appear in official Warhammer 40,000 Tyranid lore as a canonical Hive Fleet (known ones include Behemoth, Kraken, Leviathan, Gorgon, Jormungandr, Hydra, and Ouroboris). It may be fan-made, homebrew, or from unofficial sources.

To proceed objectively:

1. **Tool Call: search_web** for 'Hive Fleet Obsidian architecture diagram' and 'Hive Fleet Obsidian key components Warhammer' to find evidence.

Pending results, no verified architecture diagram or key components exist in primary sources (Codex: Tyranids, Black Library novels). If it's a custom fleet, architecture would typically mirror Tyranid hive fleets: synaptic web-led bio-ships (Hive Ships, Cruisers, Drones, Spores), ground forces (Gaunts, Warriors, Carnifexes, etc.), shadow in the Warp, and genestealer cults as vanguard.

No files available locally for read_file. Be honest: Insufficient data without web search confirmation.
