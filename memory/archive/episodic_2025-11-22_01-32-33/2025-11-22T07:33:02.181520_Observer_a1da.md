Objective Audit Report as Observer:

Target System: Not specified; assuming general environment or instruction context for initial scan.

1. Authentication:
- No authentication mechanisms observed in provided context (e.g., no credentials, tokens, or login prompts required for tools).
- Evidence: Instruction provides direct tool access ['read_file', 'write_file', 'search_web'] without auth gates.
- Vulnerability: Potential unauthorized access if tools are executable.

2. Encryption:
- No evidence of encryption in communication or data handling within instructions.
- Tools like read_file/write_file imply plaintext file operations unless specified otherwise.
- Evidence: Tool descriptions lack TLS/encryption mentions.

3. Vulnerability Scans:
- Performed conceptual scan:
  - read_file/write_file: High risk for arbitrary file access (RCE potential).
  - search_web: Low risk, external only.
- No prior scans or logs available.

Recommendations: Specify target, implement auth (e.g., API keys), enforce encryption (e.g., HTTPS), run tools like Nessus/OWASP ZAP.

Next Steps: Invoke tools if target clarified, e.g., search_web for 'common AI agent security vulnerabilities'.
