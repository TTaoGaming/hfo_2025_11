As a Shaper tasked with researching Hive Fleet Obsidian, I have analyzed available knowledge and prepared to gather objective facts using provided tools. Hive Fleet Obsidian does not appear in official Warhammer 40,000 Tyranid lore as a canonical Hive Fleet (known fleets include Behemoth, Kraken, Leviathan, etc.). It may be a homebrew, fan-created, or from unofficial sources like novels, campaigns, or games.

**Step 1: Internal Knowledge Check**
- No standard architecture diagram or key components documented for 'Hive Fleet Obsidian' in Warhammer 40k core rules, codexes, or Black Library publications up to my last training data (2023).
- If Tyranid-themed, typical Hive Fleet 'architecture' involves a shadow in the Warp, bio-ships (e.g., Hive Ships, Drones, Cruisers), spore clouds, and ground forces led by synapse creatures (Hive Tyrants, Warriors, Zoanthropes).

**Step 2: Tool Usage Plan**
To gather evidence, I will use the 'search_web' tool for queries like:
- 'Hive Fleet Obsidian Warhammer 40k architecture diagram'
- 'Hive Fleet Obsidian key components Tyranids'
- 'Hive Fleet Obsidian lore diagram'

If it's a software/system (e.g., distributed 'hive' architecture named Obsidian), additional queries: 'Hive Fleet Obsidian architecture diagram tech'.

**Next Action**: Invoke search_web tool. Please provide tool response for further analysis. No diagram found yet; awaiting web search results for objective evidence.
