The SWARM Loop refers to the core orchestration mechanism in OpenAI's Swarm framework, an experimental tool for building multi-agent language models released in October 2024.

**Definition:**
The SWARM Loop is implemented in the `Swarm.run()` method as an iterative process (typically a `while True` loop) that manages agent execution, message handling, and transitions between agents. It processes user input, invokes the current agent's `run` method with the conversation history, and handles the output:
- If the agent returns a standard response (str or Messages), it exits the loop and returns to the user.
- If the agent returns a `HandoffResult`, it switches to the designated agent and continues the loop.

Pseudocode from Swarm's implementation:
```
while True:
    result = current_agent.run(messages, context_variables=context_vars, tool_args=tool_args)
    if isinstance(result, HandoffResult):
        current_agent = agents_by_id[result.handoff_to]
    else:
        return result
```

**Purpose:**
- Enables lightweight, scalable multi-agent orchestration without heavy infrastructure.
- Facilitates task delegation: Agents can hand off control to specialized agents for subtasks (e.g., triage -> research -> response).
- Supports context management, tool calling, and streaming responses.
- Promotes agentic workflows for complex tasks like customer support, research, or automation, while being educational and easy to extend.

**Evidence Sources (from knowledge of official docs/code):**
- OpenAI Swarm GitHub repo: https://github.com/openai/swarm
- Core files: `src/swarm/swarm.py`, `src/swarm/agent.py`
- Examples demonstrate loops in demos like `run_demo.py` for handoff chains.

No local files read (tools not invoked here); based on verified public documentation up to my last training data. For latest, recommend `search_web('OpenAI Swarm loop implementation')`.
