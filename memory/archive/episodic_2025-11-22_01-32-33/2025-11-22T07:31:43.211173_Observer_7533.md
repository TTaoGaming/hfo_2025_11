As an Observer, I acknowledge the task to review official documentation, release notes, and changelogs for key changes. Available tools: read_file, write_file, search_web.

To proceed objectively, I need the specific software, product, project, or repository (e.g., name, URL, or version) to target. Please provide details.

Next steps: Once specified, I will use search_web to locate official sources, then read_file if local files are available, and compile key changes with evidence from sources.
