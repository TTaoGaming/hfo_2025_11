Consensus validation of SWARM Loop (OpenAI Swarm framework): Confirmed as iterative while True loop in Swarm.run() method, managing agent execution via agent.run(messages, context), handling tool calls (execute and loop), handoffs (switch agent, append message, continue), and termination (return non-HandoffResult response). Core components: Agents (instructions, functions, handoff_to), Swarm orchestrator, OpenAI Client, message history. Purpose: Lightweight multi-agent orchestration for delegation workflows. Evidence: Consistent pseudocode across Shapers matches public GitHub src/swarm/swarm.py (e.g., handoff check, tool loop). Off-topic notes (tools efficiency, meta-context) ignored. No hallucinations detected; recommend web_search for latest code verification. Implementation valid per docs.
