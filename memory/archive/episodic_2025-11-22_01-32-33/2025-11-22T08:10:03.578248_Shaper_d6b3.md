As a Shaper, my task is to identify all external interfaces, APIs, and communication protocols used in the system. However, no specific system documentation, codebase, architecture diagram, or description has been provided in the query or context. Objective facts based on available information:

- The only explicitly mentioned interfaces are the **available tools** provided to me: ['read_file', 'write_file', 'search_web']. These appear to be APIs or function calls exposed to agents like myself.
  - **read_file**: Likely an API for reading from the local file system (external interface to OS file I/O).
  - **write_file**: Likely an API for writing to the local file system (external interface to OS file I/O).
  - **search_web**: Likely an API for web searching, interfacing with external search engines (e.g., via HTTP/HTTPS requests to services like Google, Bing, or similar).

- **Communication protocols**:
  - File operations (read_file, write_file): Standard file system protocols (e.g., POSIX on Unix-like systems, Win32 on Windows).
  - Web search (search_web): HTTP/HTTPS (RESTful API calls, JSON over HTTP).

No evidence of other external interfaces, APIs, or protocols (e.g., no databases, message queues like RabbitMQ/Kafka, cloud services like AWS S3, gRPC, WebSockets, etc.) from the given information.

To gather more objective evidence, I recommend providing system details (e.g., codebase path, config files) or allowing tool usage:
- Use 'read_file' on relevant files (e.g., requirements.txt, docker-compose.yml, architecture docs).
- Use 'search_web' for system-specific documentation if a name/version is known.

Please provide more details for deeper analysis.
