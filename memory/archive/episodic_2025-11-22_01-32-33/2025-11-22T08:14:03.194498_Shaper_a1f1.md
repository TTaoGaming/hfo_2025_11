No specific target network, files, or initial data provided for investigation. Objective facts: Task is to investigate network topology and perimeter defenses using tools ['read_file', 'write_file', 'search_web']. Without a defined scope, IP ranges, domain, or starting point, no topology mapping or defense analysis is possible. Recommendation: Provide target details (e.g., domain, IPs) or instruct tool usage (e.g., search_web for public info on a company). No evidence of topology or defenses gathered yet.
