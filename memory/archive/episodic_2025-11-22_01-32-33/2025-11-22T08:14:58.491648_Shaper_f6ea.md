As a Shaper tasked with assessing input validation and sanitization in user-facing components, I note the following objective facts based on the provided input:

1. **No specific user-facing components provided**: The instruction lacks code, configurations, or details about particular components (e.g., forms, APIs, web apps). Assessment requires artifacts like source code, API endpoints, or frontend scripts.

2. **Available tools analysis**:
   - 'read_file': Could retrieve source code for review (e.g., read frontend JS/HTML files).
   - 'write_file': Not relevant for read-only assessment; risks unintended modifications.
   - 'search_web': Useful for gathering evidence on best practices (e.g., OWASP guidelines).

3. **General evidence on input validation/sanitization** (from established knowledge):
   - **Validation**: Ensures input matches expected format (e.g., regex for emails, length checks). Evidence: OWASP Input Validation Cheat Sheet recommends server-side validation as primary defense.
   - **Sanitization**: Escapes/modifies input to prevent injection (e.g., HTML entity encoding for XSS). Evidence: CWE-79 (XSS) lists poor sanitization as top web vuln; use libraries like DOMPurify for JS.
   - Common failures: Client-side only validation (bypassable), insufficient encoding (e.g., SQLi via unparametrized queries).

4. **Recommendations for thorough assessment**:
   - Request specific files/components for analysis.
   - Simulate inputs with fuzzing (e.g., Burp Suite evidence shows 80%+ vulns from poor handling).
   - Check for CSRF tokens, Content-Security-Policy headers.

To proceed, provide target files/code or use tools like 'read_file' on specifics. No evidence of issues in this prompt itself, as it enforces structured JSON output (inherent validation).
