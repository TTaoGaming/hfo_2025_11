Strategy: Adopt a layered threat modeling approach starting with reconnaissance of the architecture, followed by component-specific analysis, vulnerability prioritization using CVSS scoring, and culminating in mitigation recommendations through red team simulations.

Tasks:
- Research the overall architecture diagram and key components of Hive Fleet Obsidian.
- Identify all external interfaces, APIs, and communication protocols used in the system.
- Analyze authentication and authorization mechanisms for potential weaknesses.
- Examine data storage and encryption practices for vulnerabilities.
- Investigate network topology and perimeter defenses.
- Review access control lists and privilege escalation paths.
- Assess input validation and sanitization in user-facing components.
- Evaluate logging, monitoring, and intrusion detection capabilities.
- Scan for known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries and dependencies.
- Simulate common attack vectors like injection, XSS, and DDoS on the architecture.
