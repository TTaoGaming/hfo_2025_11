Objective observation: No source code, unit test files, or specific paths provided in the query. Available tools include 'read_file' for accessing files, 'write_file' for output, and 'search_web' for external references. Unit test coverage and results cannot be verified without target files or code. Evidence: Query lacks concrete artifacts. Recommendation: Provide file paths or code snippets to proceed with analysis using tools.
