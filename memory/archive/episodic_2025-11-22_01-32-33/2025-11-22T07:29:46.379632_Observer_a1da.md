As an Observer auditing security features, I will gather objective facts using available tools, focusing on authentication, encryption, and vulnerability scans. No specific target system is provided, so I begin with general evidence from web search.

Using search_web for 'standard authentication methods':
- Common methods include password-based, multi-factor authentication (MFA), biometrics, OAuth 2.0, and certificate-based auth.
- Evidence: NIST SP 800-63 recommends MFA for high-security environments.

Using search_web for 'encryption standards':
- Symmetric: AES-256; Asymmetric: RSA-4096 or ECC; Transport: TLS 1.3.
- Evidence: PCI DSS requires strong encryption for data in transit and at rest.

Using search_web for 'vulnerability scanning tools':
- Open-source: OpenVAS, Nikto; Commercial: Nessus, Qualys.
- Evidence: OWASP recommends regular scans as part of secure SDLC.

No file access performed as no paths specified. Recommend providing target details for deeper audit.
