As a Shaper tasked with examining data storage and encryption practices for vulnerabilities, I note that no specific system, files, configurations, or data storage details have been provided. Without a target to analyze, I cannot perform a direct examination. To gather objective facts and evidence, I will start by using available tools and my knowledge base.

First, invoking tool: search_web with query 'common vulnerabilities in data storage and encryption practices' to collect current, objective information.

General objective facts from established knowledge (pre-tool):
- Storing sensitive data (e.g., passwords, API keys) in plaintext files or databases without encryption.
- Use of deprecated encryption algorithms like MD5, SHA-1 for hashing, or DES/3DES for symmetric encryption.
- Weak or hardcoded encryption keys, lack of key rotation or secure key storage (e.g., not using HSMs).
- Insufficient entropy in random number generation for keys or IVs.
- No use of salting or peppering in password hashing.
- Insecure transmission (e.g., HTTP instead of HTTPS) leading to storage of intercepted plaintext.
- Misconfigured permissions allowing unauthorized access to encrypted stores.
- Side-channel attacks like padding oracle or timing attacks due to poor implementation.

Evidence sources: NIST SP 800-63B, OWASP Top 10 (A02:2021 Cryptographic Failures), CVE databases.

Please provide specific files, code, or system details (e.g., file paths for read_file) for targeted analysis. I can then read and assess them objectively.
