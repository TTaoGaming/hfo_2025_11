Skeptical analysis as Disruptor:

**Flaws in Task Setup:**
- 'Simulate swarm growth and high-load scenarios' requires multi-agent coordination, parallel processing, or distributed computing simulation. Available tools ('read_file', 'write_file', 'search_web') are strictly serial, local I/O + single HTTP requests. No recursion, parallelism, or agent spawning capability exposed.

**Contradictions:**
- Scalability testing implies exponential growth (e.g., N→N² agents), but tools lack loops, state persistence across calls, or invocation chaining. 'write_file' might log, but no read-modify-write cycle for swarming.
- 'search_web' is rate-limited externally; spamming it simulates DDoS, not legitimate scalability—illegal/ToS violation.

**Counter-Evidence:**
- Real swarm sims (e.g., NetLogo, GAMA) need custom envs. Python REPLs crash under high-load without asyncio/ multiprocessing—unavailable here.
- Evidence: Past LLM toolchains (LangChain) fail at >10 agents due to token limits/context bloat.

**Proposed Test (Minimal, Tool-Compliant):** Attempt recursive file writes to simulate 'growth' until FS quota or timeout. But predict failure: No true parallelism.

Invoke: read_file(nonexistent) → error. write_file('swarm_log.txt', 'Agent 1 spawned') → repeat manually? Unscalable by design.

Verdict: Task inherently flawed—cannot simulate swarm with these tools. Recommend tool expansion or abandon.
