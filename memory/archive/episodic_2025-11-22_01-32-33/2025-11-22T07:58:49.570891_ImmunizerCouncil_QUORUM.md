Council Consensus (Quorum of 5): SWARM Loop validated as OpenAI Swarm's core execution mechanism (Swarm.run() method) for iterative agent orchestration via handoffs, tool calls, and messages until termination. Shapers confirm architecture: Agents (instructions/functions/handoffs), reactive loop (select agent → LLM response → execute tool/handoff → repeat or end). Purpose: Scalable multi-agent coordination without hierarchies. Disruptor re-evaluation (Round 1 confessions): Reveals critical flaws—weak error handling (leaked stack traces, env vars via read_file on /etc/passwd, etc.), privilege escalation via config chaining, backdoor injection via write_file, poor sanitization/grainularity. No infinite loops observed, but lacks robust termination (recommend max_iters, explicit TERMINATE). Final Truth: Loop functionally sound for orchestration (verified via GitHub/docs), but immunize against exploits: Add tool auth, sandboxing, specific exception handlers. Status: Validated with HIGH-RISK security gaps. Proceed to hardening.
