Objective facts gathered:
- Role assigned: Observer.
- Task: Benchmark performance metrics including throughput, latency, and resource usage.
- Available tools: ['read_file', 'write_file', 'search_web'].
- Instruction: Gather objective facts and evidence.

Evidence: No specific system, application, or environment provided for benchmarking. Tools suggest file I/O and web search capabilities for data collection.

Plan: Use 'search_web' to retrieve standard benchmarking methodologies (e.g., for AI agents, servers). Use 'read_file'/'write_file' for logging metrics if files available. Require target specification for accurate metrics.
