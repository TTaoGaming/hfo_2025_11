As a Shaper tasked with reviewing access control lists (ACLs) and privilege escalation paths, I will gather objective facts using available tools where necessary. No specific system, files, or environment details are provided, so I'll start with general objective knowledge and propose tool usage for deeper analysis.

### Objective Facts on Access Control Lists (ACLs):
- **Definition**: ACLs are lists associated with objects (e.g., files, directories) specifying which users or system processes have permissions to access them. Common in POSIX (e.g., Linux with `setfacl`), NTFS (Windows), and network devices (e.g., Cisco ACLs).
- **Key Components**: Entries include principal (user/group), permissions (read/write/execute), and type (allow/deny).
- **Common Misconfigurations** (evidence from security reports like MITRE ATT&CK T1133):
  - Overly permissive ACLs (e.g., Everyone:Full Control on sensitive files).
  - Inherited permissions not properly masked.
  - Missing deny entries for unauthorized principals.
- **Verification Methods**: `getfacl` (Linux), `icacls` (Windows), `show access-lists` (Cisco).

### Objective Facts on Privilege Escalation Paths:
Privilege escalation (priv esc) involves gaining higher privileges than initially granted. Common vectors (sourced from public resources like GTFOBins, LinPEAS, WinPEAS):
- **Vertical Priv Esc** (user to root/admin):
  - SUID/SGID binaries (e.g., `find`, `vim` with GTFOBins exploits).
  - Sudo misconfigs (`sudo -l` shows runnable-as-root commands).
  - Cron jobs owned by root editing user-writable files.
  - Services running as root with writable configs or binaries.
  - Kernel exploits (e.g., Dirty COW, CVE-listed).
- **Horizontal Priv Esc** (same privilege level, different user):
  - Token impersonation, pass-the-hash/ticket.
- **Evidence Sources**: Public CVEs (e.g., CVE-2021-4034 Polkit), OSCP/PWK materials, PayloadsAllTheThings GitHub repo.

### Tool Usage Plan:
1. **search_web**: Query for latest priv esc techniques or ACL best practices.
   - Example: Search 'common Linux privilege escalation paths 2024' or 'Windows ACL misconfigurations'.
2. **read_file**: If file paths provided (e.g., /etc/sudoers, /etc/passwd), read for analysis.
3. **write_file**: Not applicable yet (read-only review unless remediation needed).

Provide specific targets (e.g., OS, file paths, output of `sudo -l`) for targeted review. What should I investigate first?
