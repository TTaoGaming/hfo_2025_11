Objective facts and evidence gathered:

1. No source code has been provided in the input for examination.
   - Evidence: The task description states 'Examine source code', but the message contains no code snippets, file paths, or references to specific files.

2. Available tools: ['read_file', 'write_file', 'search_web'].
   - Evidence: Explicitly listed in the task instructions.

3. Canonical's coding standards not yet retrieved.
   - Evidence: No prior search or file read performed; standards must be obtained via 'search_web' or documentation lookup to establish baseline for evaluation.

Next step required: Provide source code file path or content, or specify file for 'read_file' tool.
