Task received: Validate compatibility with Ubuntu versions and related Canonical tools.

Objective facts gathered (initial assessment using general knowledge; tools available for deeper verification):

- Ubuntu versions: Long Term Support (LTS) releases include 20.04 (Focal Fossa, supported until 2025), 22.04 (Jammy Jellyfish, until 2027), 24.04 (Noble Numbat, until 2029). Interim releases like 23.10 (Mantic Minotaur, short-term support).
- Canonical tools: Include apt (package manager), snap (universal packaging via Snapcraft), Ubuntu Advantage (UA) for security/maintenance (e.g., ESM, Livepatch), Landscape (management tool), Juju (orchestration for OpenStack/MAAS/Kubernetes), MAAS (metal-as-a-service).

No specific software, package, or system mentioned for compatibility validation. Please provide details on what to check (e.g., 'Is Python 3.12 compatible with Ubuntu 22.04?').

Next steps: Ready to use 'search_web' for real-time evidence, 'read_file' for local configs, or 'write_file' for reports.
