Observation initiated. Task: Benchmark performance metrics (throughput, latency, resource usage) using available tools: read_file, write_file, search_web. Objective facts: No specific target system, files, or queries provided yet. To gather evidence, recommend specifying a target (e.g., file for read/write tests) or web query for benchmarks. Initial metrics unavailable without actions.
