As a Shaper tasked with assessing input validation and sanitization in user-facing components, I note the following objective facts:

1. No specific user-facing components, code, or inputs have been provided for analysis. Assessment requires details such as source code, API endpoints, forms, or web interfaces.

2. Available tools: 'read_file', 'write_file', 'search_web'. These could be used if file paths or search queries are specified (e.g., read_file for component source code, search_web for known vulnerabilities).

3. General best practices for input validation/sanitization (gathered from standard knowledge):
   - Validate input length, type, format (e.g., regex for emails, numbers).
   - Sanitize by escaping/encoding outputs (e.g., HTML entities, SQL prepared statements).
   - Use allowlists over blocklists.
   - Handle edge cases: null, empty, special chars (e.g., <script>, XSS payloads).
   - Evidence: OWASP Top 10 (Injection, XSS) emphasizes this; no specific evidence without targets.

To proceed, provide component details or tool parameters (e.g., 'read_file: /path/to/component.js'). No evidence of issues or strengths without data. Honest assessment: Insufficient information for concrete evaluation.
