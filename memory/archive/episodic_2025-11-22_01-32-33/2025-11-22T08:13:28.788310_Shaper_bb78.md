Understood. As a Shaper, I will objectively analyze authentication and authorization mechanisms for potential weaknesses based on available facts and evidence. No specific target system, code, configuration files, or context has been provided yet. To proceed effectively:

1. **General Objective Facts on Common Weaknesses** (sourced from established security knowledge like OWASP Top 10):
   - **Broken Authentication**: Weak password policies, lack of multi-factor authentication (MFA), predictable credentials, or improper credential storage (e.g., unsalted hashes).
   - **Broken Access Control**: Missing role-based access control (RBAC), insecure direct object references (IDOR), or excessive privileges.
   - **Session Management Issues**: Session fixation, weak session IDs, no secure cookies (HttpOnly/Secure flags), or improper logout.
   - **OAuth/JWT Flaws**: Misconfigured token validation, none algorithms, or missing signature checks.
   - **Evidence Sources**: OWASP Cheat Sheets, CWE-287 (Improper Authentication), NIST SP 800-63.

2. **Next Steps Using Available Tools**:
   - Use `search_web` for up-to-date exploits or advisories (e.g., recent CVEs in auth libraries).
   - If files are available, use `read_file` to inspect configs like `/etc/passwd`, `web.config`, or app source for hard-coded secrets, weak hashing (e.g., MD5), or missing rate limiting.
   - Avoid `write_file` unless needed for safe testing (e.g., temp notes).

Provide target details (e.g., app URL, codebase, or file paths) for targeted analysis. What system should I examine first?
