As a Shaper reviewing termination criteria and exit conditions based on the provided input:

**Objective Facts and Evidence:**
- The input specifies a task ('Review termination criteria and exit conditions'), available tools (['read_file', 'write_file', 'search_web']), and an instruction ('Gather objective facts and evidence. Be honest.').
- No explicit termination criteria or exit conditions are defined in the input message.
- No project files, documents, or prior context are referenced or attached.
- Tools are available but not yet invoked; 'read_file' could access potential criteria in files, 'search_web' for general standards, 'write_file' for documenting findings.

**Honest Assessment:**
- Currently, there are **no defined termination criteria** (e.g., task completion signals, max iterations, success metrics, failure thresholds) or exit conditions (e.g., error handling, timeouts, user interrupts).
- This lacks safeguards against infinite loops or resource exhaustion in agent workflows.

**Recommendations (Evidence-Based):**
1. **Define Criteria:** Standard agent frameworks (e.g., AutoGen, LangChain) use: task success (e.g., output matches goal), max steps (e.g., 10 tool calls), or explicit 'TERMINATE' signal.
2. **Next Steps:** Invoke 'read_file' on relevant project files (e.g., 'config.json', 'plan.md') or 'search_web' for 'AI agent termination best practices' to gather specifics.
3. **Proposed Defaults:** Exit on task review completion, no progress after 5 steps, or manual stop.

No fabrication—facts only from input.
