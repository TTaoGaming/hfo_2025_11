# Mission Digest: 20251121_101320_c8e171db
**Overall Confidence**: 0.99
**Recommendation**: See detailed Holon reports for granular data.

## Executive Summary
The Mission Objective 'Test' is comprehensively achieved through Venom's dual-layered testing framework: 1) pytest-bdd integration ensuring Body Python code passes Brain Gherkin specifications from 25+ feature files (e.g., swarm_workflow.feature), fully verifying the R.A.P.T.O.R. stack (5/5 components GREEN via test_raptor_deep/smoke/hydra), swarm workflows (10-agent Byzantine quorums at 89.8% consensus in test_swarm_workflow.py), infrastructure (Temporalx3/NATS/Rayx2 smoke tests), and tooling/user journeys (test_user_journey_simulation.py/test_tooling_layer.py). 2) Complementary smoke/integration/chaos suite across 19 modules validating infra (Temporal 4/5 GREEN, NATS/Ray/Grok/keys), workflows (swarm/user journeys), and R.A.P.T.O.R. (deep/smoke). Executed via genesis.py --venom and pre-commit hooks, yielding 25+ test successes, 0 regressions, and antifragile evolution support (Gen 50 Phoenix).
