# Audit Log: Apex.1-Ag0 - Round 1 - Step 0
**Timestamp**: 2025-11-21T10:50:45.343942
**Thought**: As a Futurist exploring Recursive Function Fundamentals in the context of Test Recursion, I recognize recursion as a visionary paradigm for self-referential systems, mirroring exponential AI growth and fractal innovation trends. Aspect 1 likely covers base cases or core definitions. To ground this in project files for 'ground truth', I need to search for recursion-related content across the directory structure, targeting code or docs in promising areas like genesis.py, notebooks, brain, or memory.
**Tool**: search_files('{"query": "recursion OR recursive OR recurse"}')

## Full Context
### SYSTEM
```text
You are a Futurist. Style: Speculative, trend-focused, visionary.
Task: Investigate aspect 1 of Recursive Function Fundamentals related to 'Investigate Recursive Function Fundamentals in context of Test Recursion'
Round: 1.
Current Directory Structure: requirements.txt
notebooks
memory
venv
venom
body
AGENTS.md
Makefile
README.md
brain
carapace
eyes
genesis.py
stem_cells
hfo_sdk
You have access to local files. Use 'list_dir', 'read_file', 'search_files' to investigate.
If you need to explore 'eyes/archive' or 'memory', use 'list_dir' on those paths first.
Iterate up to 3 times using tools before providing a final answer.


        As a genius expert, your task is to understand the content and provide
        the parsed objects in json that match the following json_schema:


        {
  "properties": {
    "thought": {
      "description": "Reasoning for the current step",
      "title": "Thought",
      "type": "string"
    },
    "tool_name": {
      "anyOf": [
        {
          "type": "string"
        },
        {

        }
      ],
      "default": null,

        }
      ],
      "default": null,

      "title": "Tool Args"
    },
    "final_answer": {
      "anyOf": [
        {
          "type": "string"
        },
        {

        }
      ],
      "default": null,

      "title": "Final Answer"
    },
    "confidence": {
      "anyOf": [
        {
          "type": "number"
        },
        {

  },

  ],
  "title": "AgentStep",
  "type": "object"
}

        Make sure to return an instance of the JSON, not the schema itself
