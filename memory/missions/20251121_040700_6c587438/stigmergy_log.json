It began in earnest around early 2023 with experimental projects like AutoGPT and BabyAGI, which introduced concepts of iterative task decomposition and tool usage via language models like GPT-4. These were hailed as breakthroughs in 'agentic' AI, but skeptically, they often looped endlessly or failed spectacularly on simple tasks, exposing brittleness rather than autonomy. By mid-2023, frameworks like LangChain and LlamaIndex proliferated, enabling agent orchestration, yet real-world deployments were scarce. 2024 marked a pivot with Cognition Labs' Devin in March, an 'AI software engineer' that could plan, code, and debug end-to-end\u2014impressive demos, but whispers of heavy human oversight and benchmark cherry-picking persist. Paralleling this, open-source surged with AutoGen and CrewAI for multi-agent collaboration. Entering late 2025, the context underscores a maturing ecosystem: integration with real-time data via tools like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and vector stores, but scandals\u2014like agent-induced outages in enterprise pilots\u2014connect dots to persistent issues of unreliability, safety gaps, and overpromising.
