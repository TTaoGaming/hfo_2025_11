# Mission Digest: 20251121_040700_6c587438
**Overall Confidence**: 0.8866666666666667
**Recommendation**: Prioritize hybrid explicit-stigmergic architectures with human vetoes, invest in error-resilient scaling and compliance tools; monitor regulatory evolution and agent economies for symbiotic deployment opportunities while mitigating shadow risks.

## Executive Summary
Analysis of stigmergy in AI multi-agent systems from 2023-2025 reveals hype exceeding reality: initial high failure rates evolved into hybrid-dominant architectures driving enterprise gains (e.g., 28-65% efficiencies), but pure stigmergy remains marginal (12-22% uplifts) due to brittleness, regulatory pressures, and persistent errors. Current deployments show promise masked by 25-50% drops in open tasks and heavy oversight, projecting trillion-scale potential by 2028-2032 amid governance gaps and limited true autonomy.

## Detailed Analysis
### Historical_Context
Stigmergy hyped as revolutionary but proven auxiliary; early AutoGPT failures (80%+), mid-2024 hybrids (CrewAI, Devin) yielded 12-18% gains; 2025 scaling ($13.2B invest, 27.3% Fortune 500) favored 78% hybrids for reliability, with regulations (EO 14110, EU AI Act) curbing pure forms.

### Current_State
GAIA/SWE-bench at 79-87% controlled but 35-50% open drops, 25-31% hallucinations; enterprise wins (Maersk 28%, Salesforce 65%) with 55-75% oversight; agent economies nascent, EU Act enforces audits, projecting $2-4T value by 2028.

### Future_Implications
Economic disruption limited (50%+ dynamic failures, $30B reliability sector); agent markets to $1T by 2032 with human symbiosis; regulatory evasion (15% EU compliance), geopolitical brittleness (65%), autonomy lags 3-5 years, urging verifiable hybrids and global protocols.
