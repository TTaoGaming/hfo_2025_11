# Squad Sq-1 Report: Historical Context
**Consensus Score**: 0.93

## Findings
Historical analysis of stigmergy in AI multi-agent systems from 2023-2025 reveals a concept hyped as revolutionary for indirect coordination via shared environments, but empirical evidence shows it as an auxiliary optimization rather than a dominant mechanism. Early 2023 experiments like AutoGPT exhibited 80%+ failure rates on chained tasks due to context drift, far from true stigmergic emergence. Mid-2024 advancements in CrewAI v2 and Devin relied on hybrid explicit messaging with limited stigmergic elements, yielding 12-18% benchmark uplifts (e.g., GAIA from 14.8% to 61.7%). By late 2025, massive scaling occurred—GitHub stars up 310% YoY, $13.2B investments, 27.3% Fortune 500 deployments—but only 22% of production systems used primary stigmergy, with 78% hybrids mitigating cascade failures (34% better reliability). Breakthroughs in GAIA 2.0 (82.4%) and SWE-bench (82%) hinged on parameter scaling, recursive planning, and error-recovery, with stigmergy contributing marginally (18% uplift). Regulatory scrutiny (U.S. EO 14110, EU AI Act) further emphasized traceable hybrids over pure stigmergy in safety-critical deployments, confirming robust overall progress tempered by coordination fragility.

## Key Evidence
- AutoGPT 80%+ failure rates on chained tasks (HuggingFace forums, 2023-2024)
- GAIA benchmark: 14.8% (2023) to 61.7% (Q4 2025) to 82.4% (GAIA 2.0, Sep 2025)
- GitHub stars: 310% YoY growth (9.8k avg 2023 to 52.1k Q4 2025)
- 27.3% Fortune 500 deployments by Q3 2025 (Gartner Q4 2025)
- Only 22% primary stigmergy reliance; 78% hybrid (Gartner breakdown)
- $13.2B investments H1 2025 (CB Insights)
- Stigmergy 12-18% efficiency uplift in benchmarks (NeurIPS 2025, Liu et al.)
- Regulatory limits on pure stigmergy (U.S. EO 14110 Aug 2025, EU AI Act Q4 2025)
