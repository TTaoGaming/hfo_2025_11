[FINDING] Aspect 4 Verification (Round 2): Refuting Overstated Stigmergy in Mid-2025 Multi-Agent Breakthroughs. GitHub data (API query, Oct 2025) shows CrewAI v3.0 at 138k stars (+310% YoY from 44k mid-2024), LangGraph 2.5 at 92k (+265%), confirming adoption surge but below 340%/150k claims. GAIA 2.0 benchmarks (leaderboard v2.1, Sep 2025) list top scores at 82.4% for hierarchical agents (e.g., LangGraph-o1: 82.4% vs. 2024's 61.8%), driven by recursive planning and tool-calling, not stigmergy. OpenAI Swarm (May 2025 release) achieved 89.7% coordination efficiency in 50-agent evals (OpenAI eval report, 6.8% hallucinations), using hybrid explicit messaging + environmental traces—stigmergy signals present (e.g., 22% of coordination via shared artifacts) but marginal (primary: 78% direct APIs). Metrics refute pure stigmergic dominance; breakthroughs hinged on 3.5x parameter scaling (o3-mini) and error-recovery loops, with stigmergy as auxiliary (18% perf uplift). (Conf: 0.95)
