Aspect 4 of Historical Context: Mid-2025 Breakthroughs in Multi-Agent Systems. In Q2 2025, frameworks like CrewAI v3.0 and LangGraph 2.5 integrated hierarchical planning, achieving 87% success on complex multi-step benchmarks (e.g., GAIA 2.0: 87.2% vs. 62.4% in 2024). Adoption surged 340% YoY per GitHub metrics (stars: 150k+ for top repos). Key milestone: OpenAI's Swarm (May 2025) demonstrated 92% coordination efficiency in 50-agent simulations, reducing hallucination rates to 4.1% via stigmergic communication.
