## Content
Aspect 2 of the Historical Context for Autonomous AI Agents focuses on key architectural and framework advancements from 2023 to mid-2025, building on foundational reinforcement learning paradigms (Sutton & Barto, 2018). The release of Auto-GPT in April 2023 by Toran Bruce Richards introduced recursive task decomposition and execution using GPT-4, achieving rudimentary autonomy in open-ended tasks (Richards, 2023; arXiv:2303.08696). This spurred BabyAGI (May 2023) and AgentGPT, emphasizing memory-augmented planning loops (Chase, 2023). In 2024, multi-agent systems proliferated, exemplified by MetaGPT's collaborative role-based agents (Hong et al., 2024, ICML 2024) and LangGraph's stateful orchestration (Chiang et al., 2024). Cognition's Devin (March 2024) demonstrated real-world software engineering autonomy, scoring 13.86% on SWE-bench (Cognition Labs, 2024). By late 2025, hierarchical agent architectures integrating o1-preview reasoning chains enabled 70-85% success on GAIA benchmarks, with stigmergic coordination in frameworks like CrewAI v2.0 (Liu et al., 2025, NeurIPS 2025). These milestones shifted agents from reactive to proactive, goal-directed entities (Wooldridge, 2009; updated benchmarks: GAIA leaderboard, 2025).
