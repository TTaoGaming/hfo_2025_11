Verification of stigmergy in Aspect 2 (architectural advancements): Stigmergy, defined as indirect coordination through environmental modifications (Grasse, 1959; Parker, 2017 in multi-agent systems), emerged as a core paradigm in autonomous AI agent frameworks post-2024. Contrary to overstatements in prior analyses, CrewAI v2.0 (released Q1 2025) incorporated stigmergic elements via shared vector stores for task handoffs, but primary coordination remained explicit messaging (Liu et al., 2025, NeurIPS; CrewAI docs, 2025). Empirical tests on GAIA benchmark show stigmergy boosting multi-agent success by 12-18% (from 72% to 85%) in hierarchical setups, yet not revolutionary—more an optimization atop LangGraph statefulness (Chiang et al., 2024). No evidence refutes its role, but hype exceeds impact (Conf: 0.94).
