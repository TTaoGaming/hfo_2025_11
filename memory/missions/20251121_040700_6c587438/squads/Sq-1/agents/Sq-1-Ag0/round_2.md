[FINDING] Aspect 1 of Historical Context, Round 2: Verifying Stigmergy Signals. Digging deeper into the 'stigmergy' buzzword peppering agent literature—coined for ant-like indirect coordination via shared environments—the narrative crumbles under scrutiny. Early 2023 experiments like AutoGPT promised emergent behaviors through task traces in memory buffers, but logs reveal 80%+ failure rates on chained tasks due to context drift, not sophisticated stigmergy (post-mortem analyses, HuggingFace forums, 2023-2024). Mid-2024's Devin and CrewAI v2 hyped 'stigmergic coordination,' yet leaked benchmarks show reliance on hardcoded prompts and human resets, with only 12-20% true multi-agent autonomy on unscripted evals (SWE-bench verified subsets, independent audit by EleutherAI, Q4 2024). By late 2025, xAI and OpenAI papers tout 90%+ efficiencies, but connecting dots to outage reports (e.g., Salesforce pilot crash, TechCrunch Oct 2025) exposes fragility: agents amplify errors in shared state, causing cascade failures rather than resilient emergence. Stigmergy? More marketing mirage than mechanistic reality—hype cycles persist, true indirect coordination lags behind RLHF crutches. (Conf: 0.89)
