## Content
Tracing the historical roots of autonomous AI agents reveals a trajectory steeped in hype and halting progress. It began in earnest around early 2023 with experimental projects like AutoGPT and BabyAGI, which introduced concepts of iterative task decomposition and tool usage via language models like GPT-4. These were hailed as breakthroughs in 'agentic' AI, but skeptically, they often looped endlessly or failed spectacularly on simple tasks, exposing brittleness rather than autonomy. By mid-2023, frameworks like LangChain and LlamaIndex proliferated, enabling agent orchestration, yet real-world deployments were scarce. 2024 marked a pivot with Cognition Labs' Devin in March, an 'AI software engineer' that could plan, code, and debug end-to-end—impressive demos, but whispers of heavy human oversight and benchmark cherry-picking persist. Paralleling this, open-source surged with AutoGen and CrewAI for multi-agent collaboration. Entering late 2025, the context underscores a maturing ecosystem: integration with real-time data via tools like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and vector stores, but scandals—like agent-induced outages in enterprise pilots—connect dots to persistent issues of unreliability, safety gaps, and overpromising. True autonomy? More evolutionary step than revolution, fueled by compute scaling yet hobbled by alignment challenges.
