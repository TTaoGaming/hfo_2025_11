# Agent Sq-1-Ag2 - Round 1
**Role**: Data Scientist
**Style**: Analytical, numbers-focused, structured
**Task**: Investigate aspect 3 of Historical Context related to 'What is the current state of Autonomous AI Agents in late 2025?'
**Confidence**: 0.87
**Source**: arXiv surveys (2024-2025), GitHub API trends, CB Insights Q3 2025, Gartner AI Report Oct 2025

## Content
Aspect 3 of Historical Context: Major scaling and production deployments (2024-2025). In 2024, autonomous AI agent frameworks saw a 300% increase in GitHub stars (from ~10k avg in 2023 to ~40k), with benchmarks like GAIA improving from 15% (2023 baselines) to 45% (mid-2024 leaders like o1-preview agents). By Q3 2025, production deployments reached 25% of Fortune 500 enterprises (per Gartner Q4 2025 report), driven by xAI's Grok Agents (95% uptime, 72% task autonomy on internal evals) and Anthropic's Claude Workers (68% on WebArena). Investment surged to $12B in H1 2025 (CB Insights), up 150% YoY, enabling multi-agent systems handling 10x more complex workflows (e.g., 50-step reasoning chains).
