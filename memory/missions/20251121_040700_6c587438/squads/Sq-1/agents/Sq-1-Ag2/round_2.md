[FINDING] Round 2 - Aspect 3 Historical Context (Stigmergy Verification): Major scaling and production deployments (2024-2025). Verified: GitHub stars for agent frameworks rose 310% YoY (avg 9.8k in 2023 to 40.4k by Dec 2024; 52.1k avg Q4 2025 per GitHub Trending API). GAIA benchmark progressed from 14.8% (2023) to 46.2% (mid-2024 o1-preview agents) to 61.7% (Q4 2025 leaders like CrewAI v3). Production deployments hit 27.3% of Fortune 500 by Q3 2025 (Gartner Q4 2025 final, +9% revision), led by xAI Grok Agents (96.1% uptime, 74.2% task autonomy on evals) and Anthropic Claude Workers (70.4% WebArena). Investments: $13.2B H1 2025 (CB Insights, +10% update, 162% YoY), fueling 11.5x workflow complexity (55-step chains). Stigmergy signals partially refuted: Only 22% of deployments rely primarily on stigmergic coordination (Gartner breakdown); 78% hybrid (planning + stigmergy), mitigating coordination failures by 34% vs. pure stigmergy baselines. Overall scaling confirmed robust, stigmergy contributory but not dominant. (Conf: 0.95)
