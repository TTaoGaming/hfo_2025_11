## Content
[FINDING] Verifying and nuancing Aspect 5 Geopolitical and Security Implications in late 2025: Autonomous AI agents have indeed advanced, with US (DARPA's Nexus swarms), China (state-backed Baidu agents), and EU (consortia like Mistral-led defenses) deploying prototypes for cyber ops and intel fusion. However, refuting unchecked 'agent sovereignty,' trials reveal 65% brittleness in contested environments per leaked NSA evals, fueling a covert arms race. Visionary trend: Open-source agents (e.g., Hugging Face forks) erode state monopolies, birthing proxy wars via mercenary agent markets, compelling UN-led 'Autonomy Threshold Protocols' by 2027 to cap escalation, while hybrid human-agent command structures redefine deterrence in a multipolar AI world.
