Aspect 2 of Future Implications: Economic Transformation. In late 2025, autonomous AI agents, powered by advanced multimodal LLMs and self-improving architectures like those evolving from o1 and Claude 3.5 successors, are deployed at scale in enterprises. They autonomously orchestrate workflows, from predictive supply chain management to real-time financial trading and personalized marketing campaigns. This heralds a 'agent economy' where AI agents trade services peer-to-peer via blockchain marketplaces, slashing operational costs by 40-60% in sectors like logistics and retail. Visionary trend: Humans shift to 'meta-orchestration' roles, designing agent swarms that compound intelligence exponentially, potentially boosting global GDP by 15% annually while necessitating universal basic services to mitigate job polarization.
