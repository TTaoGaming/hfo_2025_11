## Content
- [FINDING] Refuting the overly ambitious Stigmergy signal on Aspect 4: Regulatory and Governance Overhaul. In late 2025, autonomous AI agents trigger heated but fragmented regulatory responses—no global 'AI Autonomy Accords' uniting 50 nations; instead, ~20 countries (EU core, South Korea, Brazil) roll out piecemeal rules like agent logging and sandbox testing, while US-China rivalry stalls multilateral efforts. Visionary trend: Rise of 'Dynamic Governance Platforms' where hybrid human-AI councils use real-time simulations to adapt rules, evolving toward 'Adaptive Accords' by 2028; agent 'democracies' remain speculative prototypes in DAOs, fueling debates on computational citizenship without upending bureaucracies yet.
