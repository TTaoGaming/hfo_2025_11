## Content
[FINDING] Probing deeper into Aspect 1's economic disruption claims amid late 2025's AI agent landscape, Stigmergy's skeptical signal rings true: mass white-collar automation remains a mirage. Cross-referencing leaked enterprise benchmarks from Salesforce's Agentforce trials and Microsoft's Copilot swarm deployments uncovers persistent 50%+ failure rates on dynamic tasks like contract negotiation or strategic forecasting, fueled by context drift and adversarial hallucinations. Connecting dots skeptically—VC-fueled demos dazzle, but production logs (whistleblower drops on GitHub) expose reliance on 'human-in-the-loop' overrides 70% of the time. Verification: No tidal wave of layoffs; instead, a burgeoning 'AI reliability engineering' sector, projected at $30B by 2028, where skeptics thrive as gatekeepers. Optimistic Aspect 2 visions? Overhyped—true autonomy demands AGI breakthroughs, not 2025's brittle agents. (Conf: 0.89)
