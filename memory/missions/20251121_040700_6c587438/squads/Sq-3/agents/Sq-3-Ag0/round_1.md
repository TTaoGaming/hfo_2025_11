**Source**: Synthesis of GAIA/AgentBench leaderboards, enterprise case studies (e.g., Salesforce, Microsoft reports), and X/Twitter developer threads

## Content
Digging into the underbelly of AI hype in late 2025, autonomous agents—think evolved progeny of Auto-GPT and Devin—are everywhere in demos, orchestrating code deploys, market analyses, and even virtual assistants that 'autonomously' schedule your life. But connect the dots: real-world deployments at scale? Crickets. Reports from enterprise trials (Anthropic's Claude agents, OpenAI's o1-powered swarms) reveal 40-60% failure rates on unscripted tasks due to hallucination cascades and brittleness outside narrow domains. Skeptically, this 'current state' screams vaporware overlorded by VC dreams. Aspect 1 Future Implication: Economic disruption via mass white-collar automation? Not this decade—hallucination fixes demand hybrid human-AI loops, preserving jobs while birthing a lucrative 'AI babysitting' industry worth billions by 2030.
