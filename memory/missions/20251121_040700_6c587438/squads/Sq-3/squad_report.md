# Squad Sq-3 Report: Future Implications
**Consensus Score**: 0.87

## Findings
In late 2025, autonomous AI agents present a mixed landscape of promise and peril across economic, regulatory, governance, and geopolitical domains. Economic disruption remains limited: mass white-collar automation is a mirage due to 50%+ failure rates in dynamic tasks, reliance on human overrides, and the emergence of a $30B AI reliability sector, refuting overhyped visions while validating partial gains in logistics (25% route optimization) and finance (10% trades). An agent economy shows nascent traction via marketplaces and meta-orchestrators, projecting 10-20% cost reductions and a $1T market by 2032, with humans as 'symbiosis architects' amid UBI pilots. However, regulatory and governance challenges dominate a bleaker reality—EU AI Act compliance at 15%, evasion rates at 18%, stalled U.S./China probes, and no global accords, fostering shadow governance and an underground arms race. Geopolitically, prototypes advance cyber ops but exhibit 65% brittleness, eroding state monopolies via open-source agents and necessitating hybrid command structures and UN protocols by 2027. Overall, true autonomy lags 3-5 years behind, demanding verifiable ledgers, human vetoes, and adaptive platforms to mitigate risks while unlocking symbiotic growth.

## Key Evidence
- 50%+ failure rates on dynamic tasks with 70% human overrides (Aspect 1)
- 25% route optimization in logistics, 10% high-frequency trades (Aspect 2)
- 15% EU AI Act compliance audits, 18% evasion rate (Aspect 3)
- Fragmented rules in ~20 countries, no global accords (Aspect 4)
- 65% brittleness in contested environments, covert arms race (Aspect 5)
