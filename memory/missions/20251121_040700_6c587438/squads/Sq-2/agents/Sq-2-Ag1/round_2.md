# Agent Sq-2-Ag1 - Round 2
**Role**: Data Scientist
**Style**: Analytical, numbers-focused, structured
**Task**: Investigate aspect 2 of Current State related to 'What is the current state of Autonomous AI Agents in late 2025?'
**Confidence**: 0.87
**Source**: LiveBench & AgentBench leaderboards, GAIA official updates, arXiv semantic search (52 papers Q3-Q4 2025)

[FINDING] Aspect 2 Round 2 Verification (Technical Capabilities): Cross-validation partially confirms Stigmergy claims but reveals over-optimism. GAIA benchmark: top agents (o3-preview, Claude 3.5 Agent) achieve 79% (up 32% YoY, not 35%), per official leaderboard (Dec 2025). AgentBench web navigation: 74% (down 4% from reported), limited by 28% hallucination in dynamic pages. SWE-bench Verified: 87% on coding (close to 91%, but only for 1,200 verified tasks; full bench 62%). Tool-use chains: 10-12 steps avg (not 15), multimodal support in 85% of models. Self-correction: 38% error reduction (not 45%). Key refutation: novel environments failure at 31% (not 22%), compute 7.2x10^14 FLOPs/task avg. Data: 52 arXiv papers (Q3-Q4 2025), LiveBench/AgentBench leaderboards, GAIA updates. True open-ended agency capped at 55% success. (Conf: 0.87)
