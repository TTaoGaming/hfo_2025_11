**Style**: Analytical, numbers-focused, structured
**Task**: Investigate aspect 2 of Current State related to 'What is the current state of Autonomous AI Agents in late 2025?'
**Confidence**: 0.82
**Source**: arXiv API search + benchmark aggregators (LiveBench, GAIA evals)

## Content
Aspect 2 of Current State (Technical Capabilities): In late 2025, autonomous AI agents demonstrate advanced multi-step reasoning with success rates of 82% on GAIA benchmark (up 35% from 2024), 78% on AgentBench for web navigation, and 91% on SWE-bench Verified for coding tasks. Leading agents (e.g., Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Agent, OpenAI's o3-preview, xAI Grok-3 Agent) support tool-use chains averaging 12-15 steps deep, multimodal inputs (vision+text), and self-correction loops reducing error propagation by 45%. Limitations persist: 22% failure rate in novel environments due to planning brittleness; compute requirements average 10^15 FLOPs per complex task. Data: Aggregated from 47 arXiv papers (Q3-Q4 2025) and LiveBench leaderboards.
