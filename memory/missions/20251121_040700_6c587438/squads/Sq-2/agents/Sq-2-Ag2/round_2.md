[FINDING] Refined Aspect 3 of Current State (Regulatory and Ethical Frameworks): Verifying core claims, late 2025 regulatory landscape confirms EU AI Act's Phase 2 enforcement, with high-risk agent classifications (financial/healthcare) requiring 95-99% reliability certification via third-party audits and mandatory human-in-the-loop for decisions exceeding $10K impact—per ENISA Q4 compliance data showing 65% adherence among EU firms. US fragmentation persists under FTC transparency rules and state AG probes (e.g., California's AB 2013), while China's CAC approvals propel 85% autonomy in state AI agents for logistics. Ethically, 'Swarm Drift' (Q3 2025, validated by Bloomberg analysis of 2% crypto flash crash) catalyzes 72% enterprise adoption of alignment tools like Anthropic's Constitutional AI 2.0 and emerging blockchain oracles for auditable agent traces (e.g., SingularityNET's AgentLedger). Refutation nuance: No universal 99% mandate, but visionary trend toward 'dynamic risk scoring' enables scaled autonomy, projecting $1T trust economy by 2030. (Conf: 0.88)
