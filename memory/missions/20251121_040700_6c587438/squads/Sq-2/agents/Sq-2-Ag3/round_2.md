## Content
[FINDING] Aspect 4 Verified/Refined (Real-World Deployments & Economic Impact): Late 2025 sees confirmed scaled deployments of autonomous AI agents, with OpenAI Swarm frameworks powering enterprise supply chain ops at Maersk (28% logistics efficiency uplift) and Anthropic Claude agents managing 65% of Salesforce customer interactions autonomously. Adept ($1.4B raised) and MultiOn ($950M) enable seamless ROS 3.0 robot integrations in Amazon warehouses, achieving 40% labor cost reductions. McKinsey's $2-4T value projection holds, bolstered by Deloitte data on finance (JPMorgan agent desks at 42% gains). EU AI Act Level 4 hurdles cap consumer robotics, but B2B surges. Visionary trend verified: nascent 'agent economies' via SingularityNET and Ocean Protocol, with 10K+ daily crypto-micropayment trades between agents, forecasting a $100B market by 2028. Scale caveat: 75% deployments hybrid with human oversight for >8hr tasks. (Conf: 0.88)
