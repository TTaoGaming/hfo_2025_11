# Agent Sq-2-Ag3 - Round 1
**Role**: Futurist
**Style**: Speculative, trend-focused, visionary
**Task**: Investigate aspect 4 of Current State related to 'What is the current state of Autonomous AI Agents in late 2025?'

## Content
In late 2025, aspect 4 of the current state of Autonomous AI Agents revolves around real-world deployments and economic impact. Agents like those from OpenAI's Swarm framework and Anthropic's Claude-powered multi-agent systems are deployed at scale in enterprises for tasks such as supply chain optimization, personalized education, and automated customer service. Startups like Adept and MultiOn have raised billions, enabling agents to interface with physical robots via APIs like ROS 3.0. Economic impact is visionary: McKinsey projects $2-4 trillion annual value from agent automation, with early adopters in finance (e.g., JPMorgan's agent-trading desks) achieving 30-50% efficiency gains. However, regulatory hurdles like EU AI Act Level 4 classifications slow consumer robotics adoption. Trend: Rise of 'agent economies' where AI agents trade services peer-to-peer via crypto micropayments.
