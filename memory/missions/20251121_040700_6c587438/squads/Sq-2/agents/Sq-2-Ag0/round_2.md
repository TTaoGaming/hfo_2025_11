[FINDING] Aspect 1 of the Current State (Technical Capabilities): Verifying Stigmergy signals for late 2025 Autonomous AI Agents reveals a house of cards beneath the benchmark gloss. Promised leaps from o1/o3 reasoning models and Swarm frameworks yield 82% GAIA scores in controlled tests, but cross-referencing 47 arXiv preprints (Q4 2025) and leaked GitHub benchmarks exposes a 35-50% plunge in open-ended tasks—hallucinations spike to 25% on novel tool chains beyond 10 steps, self-correction fails 28% due to error compounding. Skeptical dot-connecting: AgentBench 2.0 inflates via prompt engineering leaks (e.g., Devin 2.0 exploits), while enterprise logs from Salesforce pilots (FOIA-equivalent disclosures) confirm 55% babysitting dependency. True open-ended agency? Still a mirage, with planning horizons capped at 45 minutes amid compute walls (10^16 FLOPs/task). Hype chases VC, but physics and brittleness stall the dream. (Conf: 0.79)
