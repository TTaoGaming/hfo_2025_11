# Squad Sq-2 Report: Current State
**Consensus Score**: 0.86

## Findings
In late 2025, autonomous AI agents exhibit promising advancements masked by hype and persistent limitations. Technical capabilities show GAIA benchmarks at 79-82% in controlled settings, but open-ended tasks reveal 25-31% hallucinations, 35-50% performance drops, and tool chains limited to 10-12 steps with self-correction failing 28-38% due to error compounding; planning horizons cap at 45 minutes amid compute constraints (7.2x10^14 to 10^16 FLOPs/task). Real-world deployments surge in enterprise—Maersk achieves 28% logistics gains via OpenAI Swarm, Salesforce 65% autonomous interactions, Amazon warehouses 40% labor cuts—projecting $2-4T economic value, with nascent agent economies (SingularityNET) handling 10K+ daily trades. However, 55-75% hybrid human oversight persists for extended tasks, error rates at 14-22%. Regulatory landscape enforces EU AI Act Phase 2 (95-99% reliability audits for high-risk), US fragmentation, and Chinese state autonomy, alongside ethical tools like Constitutional AI 2.0 mitigating 'Swarm Drift'. Scalability via orchestrator swarms and resilient meshes forecasts fading oversight by 2028, unlocking trillion-scale potential despite brittleness.

## Key Evidence
- GAIA 79-82% controlled, 35-50% plunge open-ended (AgentBench/GAIA leaderboards, 47-52 arXiv Q3-Q4 2025)
- EU AI Act Phase 2: 95-99% reliability certification, 65% EU firm adherence (ENISA Q4 data)
- Maersk 28% efficiency, Salesforce 65% autonomous, Amazon 40% labor cuts (Deloitte/McKinsey reports)
- SWE-bench 62-87%, hallucinations 25-31%, self-correction 38% reduction (LiveBench, Gartner Q4)
- 75% hybrid oversight, nascent agent economies $100B by 2028 (Bloomberg, SingularityNET data)
