Deep dive into eyes/archive/obsidian_synapse_scan_2024-07.dat (lines 1679-1923) and memory/hivefleet_logs/entry_Obsidian_4.4.txt reveals synaptic efficiency rebounding to 68% post-splintering, bolstered by emergent Norn Emissary synaptic relays (cf. Obsidian State Report v2.2, p. 47-52; GW Codex: Tyranids 10th Ed., p. 118). Fluctuations attributed to adaptive pheromone recalibration rather than collapse, with behavioral coordination intact in 82% of observed splinter tendrils (eyes/archive/tendril_cohesion_metrics_v5.1).
