# Mission Digest: 20251121_062709_f5b811d7
**Overall Confidence**: 0.85
**Recommendation**: Prioritize Obsidian Reach surveillance, synaptic signal forensics vs. psy-ops, shadow-warp defenses, and cult purges; prepare for Phase IV convergence while exploiting entropy vulnerabilities.

## Executive Summary
Hive Fleet Obsidian confirmed as stealth-adapted Kraken splinter (Cycle 45-47 origin, obsidian carapace, biomass peak 1.2e9 tons), dormant post-Cycle 52 but resurging decentralized via stigmergic webs (72-82% integrity, 58% biomass reconstitution, 68-71% synaptic rebound). Future polarized: high resurgence risk (ghost fleets, Nightfall Cascade by M42.045, 71% shadow-warp threat) vs. genestealer psy-ops (76% signal fabrication). Archival redactions and low cohesion (23-29%) complicate assessment.

## Detailed Analysis
### historical_context
Originating post-Ichar IV from Kraken (Cycle 45 fragments, 73-100% log matches), stealth gene-mods (auspex coeff 0.92), dormancy after Cycle 52 due to purges/Necron intercepts (92% Leviathan misattribution, 41% Ordo Xenos tampering). No independent baseline; fragmented sub-swarms/cults persist (consensus 0.9).

### current_state
Decentralized resurgence in Obsidian Reach (19 tendrils, bio-shrouds, 9-23 cults), pheromone webs/Norn Emissaries yield 72-82% integrity, 58% biomass, 68-71% synapse (refuting collapse claims; 22-28% entropy). Leviathan fragmentation aids (consensus 0.88).

### future_implications
Stigmergic renaissance projected (biomass +18% QoQ, memetic/noospheric infiltration, Leviathan-scale by M42.045) but 76% signals potentially psy-ops (genestealer memetics, feral devolution). Shadow-warp risk 71% in 24-36 months; low Imperial mitigation (consensus 0.77).

### evidence_synthesis
High-confidence archival/log matches; pheromone/synaptic scans; cult metrics/Codex alignment; psy-op discrepancies urge verification.
