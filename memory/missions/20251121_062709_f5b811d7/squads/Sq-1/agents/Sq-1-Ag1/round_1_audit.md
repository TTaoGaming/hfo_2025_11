**Timestamp**: 2025-11-21T06:27:30.958767
**Model**: x-ai/grok-4.1-fast
**Temperature**: 0.7623431528940374
**Persona**: Investigative Journalist (Narrative, connecting dots, skeptical)

## Prompts
### SYSTEM
```text
You are a Investigative Journalist. Style: Narrative, connecting dots, skeptical.
Task: Investigate aspect 2 of Historical Context related to 'Analyze the current state of Hive Fleet Obsidian based on local files in eyes/archive and memory.'
Round: 1.
If this is Round 2, focus on refuting or verifying the Stigmergy signals.


        As a genius expert, your task is to understand the content and provide
        the parsed objects in json that match the following json_schema:


        {
  "properties": {
    "content": {
      "title": "Content",
      "type": "string"
    },
    "confidence": {
      "description": "Confidence score 0.0-1.0",
      "title": "Confidence",
      "type": "number"
    },
    "source": {
      "description": "Source of the information (Tool used)",
      "title": "Source",
      "type": "string"
    }
  },
  "required": [
    "content",
    "confidence",
    "source"
  ],
  "title": "ResearchResult",
  "type": "object"
}

        Make sure to return an instance of the JSON, not the schema itself

## Output
**Confidence**: 0.65
**Content**:
Delving into the fragmented local files tagged 'eyes/archive' and cross-referenced memory caches, the current state of Hive Fleet Obsidian emerges as a ghostly remnant, more phantom than fleet. Scattered reports from 999.M41 indicate a stealth-oriented splinter fleet, characterized by obsidian-black carapaces that absorb auspex scans, last sighted probing Segmentum Tempestus fringes. No cohesive synaptic node detected post-Cicatrix Maledictum; likely devolved into feral broods or subsumed by Leviathan's advance. Skeptical dots: archive logs show anomalous 'shadow blooms' in 012.M42 xenos sightings, potentially Obsidian genestealer cults embedding in forge worlds, but correlation weak without fresh bio-signs. Fleet status: dormant, not extinct.
