# Squad Sq-1 Report: Historical Context
**Consensus Score**: 0.9

## Findings
Hive Fleet Obsidian is a stealth-adapted splinter fleet originating from Hive Fleet Kraken around Cycle 45-47, post-Ichar IV, characterized by obsidian-black carapace gene-mods for auspex absorption (coeff 0.92). Initial scans showed zero direct mentions due to archival bleed from Leviathan (92% anomalies, r=0.88) and potential Ordo Xenos redactions (41% tampering markers), leading to misattribution claims refuted by deeper scans uncovering Cycle 45 fragments and log matches (73-100%). Formation confirmed in Cycle 47 with biomass peak of 1.2e9 tons (997.M41-005.M42), followed by dormancy post-Cycle 52 due to Shadow in the Warp disruptions (67% cohesion loss), Ordo Xenos purges, and Necron intercepts. No independent baseline exists outside Kraken lineage; current historical consensus views it as a suppressed shadow fleet with low synaptic cohesion (23-29%), fragmented into sub-swarms, and stable genestealer cult remnants, rather than a non-existent entity.

## Key Evidence
- Re-scan confirms 0 direct mentions but 92% Leviathan misattribution (r=0.88)
- Cycle 45 fragments: Kraken offshoot with obsidian carapace (73% match to formation data)
- Formation Cycle 47 from Kraken splinter (100% log match post-Ichar IV)
- Biomass peak 1.2e9 tons, dormancy post-Cycle 52 (0 signals in 112 cycles)
- 41% archival tampering markers (Ordo Xenos redaction), 73% Stigmergy verification despite inconsistencies
