# Squad Sq-3 Report: Future Implications
**Consensus Score**: 0.77

## Findings
The future implications for Hive Fleet Obsidian reveal a polarized analysis of stigmergy signals. Confirmatory findings (Aspects 1-3, confs 0.84-0.85) validate authentic synaptic coordination via cross-verified biomorphic scans, pheromone gradients (14% above baseline), and biomass accretion (+18% QoQ), projecting a stigmergic renaissance: decentralized 'ghost fleets', quantum-entangled relays enabling Leviathan-scale resurgence by M42.045, memetic adaptability infiltrating noospherics, and elevated shadow-in-the-warp risk (71% within 24-36 months) with low Imperial mitigation (19%). Contradictory evidence (Aspects 4-5, confs 0.71-0.79) exposes 76% of signals as genestealer psy-ops mimicking Tyranid emissions to bait patrols, aligned with rogue servitors and cult vox-logs, indicating feral devolution, diluted Hive Mind cohesion, and negligible threats pre-M42.040 amid Chaos exploitation. Consensus tempers optimism for resurgence, urging scrutiny of archival gaps amid Inquisition meddling.

## Key Evidence
- 92% correlation with M41.892 hive node activations
- Pheromone gradients 14% above feral baseline; 91% alignment with gestation patterns
- Biomass 2.47e11 tons/cycle (+18% QoQ); shadow-warp risk 71%
- 76% fabrication via genestealer memetic viruses matching M41.995 psy-ops
- Discrepancy with servitor noospheric echoes; cult confessions in vox-logs
