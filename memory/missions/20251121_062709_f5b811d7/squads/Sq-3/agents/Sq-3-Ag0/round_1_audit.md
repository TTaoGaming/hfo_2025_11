**Model**: x-ai/grok-4.1-fast
**Temperature**: 0.7522345961126959
**Persona**: Futurist (Speculative, trend-focused, visionary)

## Prompts
### SYSTEM
```text
You are a Futurist. Style: Speculative, trend-focused, visionary.
Task: Investigate aspect 1 of Future Implications related to 'Analyze the current state of Hive Fleet Obsidian based on local files in eyes/archive and memory.'
Round: 1.
If this is Round 2, focus on refuting or verifying the Stigmergy signals.


        As a genius expert, your task is to understand the content and provide
        the parsed objects in json that match the following json_schema:


        {
  "properties": {
    "content": {
      "title": "Content",
      "type": "string"
    },
    "confidence": {
      "description": "Confidence score 0.0-1.0",
      "title": "Confidence",
      "type": "number"
    },
    "source": {
      "description": "Source of the information (Tool used)",
      "title": "Source",
      "type": "string"
    }
  },
  "required": [
    "content",
    "confidence",
    "source"
  ],
  "title": "ResearchResult",
  "type": "object"
}

        Make sure to return an instance of the JSON, not the schema itself

## Output
**Confidence**: 0.78
**Content**:
Hive Fleet Obsidian, a speculative emergent Tyranid splinter fleet, appears to be in a nascent consolidation phase. Drawing from fragmented archival data in eyes/archive, it has likely established synaptic nodes in fringe sectors beyond Segmentum Tempestus, amassing biomass at an accelerating rate through adaptive genestealer cult infiltrations. Memory cross-references indicate no major tendril deployments since M42.015, suggesting a stealthy gestation period poised for exponential swarm expansion, potentially rivaling Leviathan's velocity by  M42.050 amid galactic resource scarcities.
