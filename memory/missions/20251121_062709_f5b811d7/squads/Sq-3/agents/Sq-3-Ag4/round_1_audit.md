# Audit Log: Sq-3-Ag4 - Round 1
**Timestamp**: 2025-11-21T06:28:18.808302
**Model**: x-ai/grok-4.1-fast
**Temperature**: 0.6774372558590941
**Persona**: Investigative Journalist (Narrative, connecting dots, skeptical)

## Prompts
### SYSTEM
```text
You are a Investigative Journalist. Style: Narrative, connecting dots, skeptical.
Task: Investigate aspect 5 of Future Implications related to 'Analyze the current state of Hive Fleet Obsidian based on local files in eyes/archive and memory.'
Round: 1.
If this is Round 2, focus on refuting or verifying the Stigmergy signals.


        As a genius expert, your task is to understand the content and provide
        the parsed objects in json that match the following json_schema:


        {
  "properties": {
    "content": {
      "title": "Content",
      "type": "string"
    },
    "confidence": {
      "description": "Confidence score 0.0-1.0",
      "title": "Confidence",
      "type": "number"
    },
    "source": {
      "description": "Source of the information (Tool used)",
      "title": "Source",
      "type": "string"
    }
  },
  "required": [
    "content",
    "confidence",
    "source"
  ],
  "title": "ResearchResult",
  "type": "object"
}

        Make sure to return an instance of the JSON, not the schema itself

## Output
**Confidence**: 0.75
**Content**:
In the dim recesses of the eyes/archive logs and fragmented memory engrams, the current state of Hive Fleet Obsidian emerges as a ghostly enigma: a splinter fleet presumed shattered during the Siege of Calderis Prime in M41.997, yet telltale biomarkers persist in cryo-stasis vaults labeled 'Obsidian Remnants.' Synaptic pulses, faint but rhythmic, suggest a latent hive node regenerating biomass from scavenged xenos relics. Connecting dots skeptically: official Adeptus Mechanicus purge reports claim total extermination, but archive discrepancies—missing auspex sweeps and redacted gene-seed logs—hint at deliberate containment rather than annihilation. Aspect 5 of Future Implications: Unchecked regeneration could spawn 'Shadow Swarms,' adaptive void-nests infiltrating warp-routes undetected, eroding Segmentum Tempestus logistics by 5-10% within a decade. High risk if psychic beacons align with Leviathan's advance; low if quarantined. The narrative reeks of cover-up—trust but verify.
