Synthesize these 5 findings into a cohesive report on Future Implications.

Data:
- [FINDING] Aspect 1 of Future Implications for Hive Fleet Obsidian: Cross-verification of Stigmergy signals via eyes/archive biomorphic scans and memory synaptic logs refutes dismissal as lures or artifacts—pulses exhibit 92% correlation with pre-Leviathan hive node activations (M41.892 baseline). Visionary trend: This validates a nascent stigmergic renaissance, enabling emergent swarm intelligence sans central synapse, accelerating biomass fusion trends by 250% QoQ. By M42.030, projections envision Obsidian pioneering 'ghost fleets'—decentralized void-adapted tendrils infiltrating warp shadows, reshaping Tyranid evolution toward pan-galactic ubiquity amid Imperial atrophy. (Conf: 0.84) (Conf: 0.84)
- [FINDING] Round 2 Verification of Stigmergy Signals for Aspect 2 Future Implications: Cross-referencing eyes/archive logs (Obsidian Veil auspex intercepts, M42.012-018) and memory engrams reveals confirmatory patterns in stigmergic pheromone gradients—subtle bio-trails modulating void-nest mycelia growth at 14% above baseline feral swarms. Refutation unlikely (anomalies <5% decoy probability); instead, visionary trends project stigmergy catalyzing quantum-entangled synaptic relays, accelerating Obsidian's resurgence to Leviathan-scale by M42.045. This foreshadows a paradigm shift: Tyranid swarms evolving memetic adaptability, infiltrating noospheric defensives for symbiotic human augmentation, potentially averting total galactic extinction via hybrid hegemony. (Conf: 0.85) (Conf: 0.85)
- [FINDING] Aspect 3 of Future Implications (Round 2: Stigmergy Verification): Cross-analysis of eyes/archive logs and memory engrams verifies Stigmergy signals as authentic synaptic coordination markers with 82% confidence, matching 11/14 splinter vectors (convergence sigma reduced to 0.09 from 0.12). Pulse anomalies (freq: 0.31 Hz ±0.07) align 91% with historical Tyranid gestation patterns, refuting 78% of fabricated lure hypotheses via spectral entropy comparison (H=2.14 vs. cult decoy baseline H=3.62). Biomass accretion holds at 2.47e11 tons/cycle (+18% QoQ), elevating shadow-in-the-warp risk to 71% probability within 24-36 months. Mitigation viability revised downward to 19% (Imperial Navy: 47 vessels, projected attrition 34% amid 15% redeployments). (Conf: 0.84) (Conf: 0.84)
- [FINDING] Aspect 4 of Future Implications for Hive Fleet Obsidian (Round 2: Stigmergy Signals Scrutiny): Probing the anomalous Stigmergy pings flagged in eyes/archive and memory logs, spectral decrypts reveal 76% fabrication—pings laced with genestealer memetic viruses mimicking Tyranid emissions to bait Imperial patrols into nebula ambushes, cross-matched against M41.995 cult psy-ops in Veil Sector (deviation <0.09). Genuine remnants (24% purity) pulse erratically from bio-rafts, hinting at feral devolution rather than consolidation, diluting Hive Mind cohesion as predicted. Dots connect skeptically: No unified resurgence viable without Norn Emissary intervention; instead, Chaos warbands (logged incursions +14% QoQ) exploit the chaos, feasting on splinter broods. Projection refined: Supply line threats negligible pre-M42.040, but viral cults amplify shadow influence. Memory scrub-marks scream Inquisition meddling—trust the gaps. (Conf: 0.79) (Conf: 0.79)
- Probing deeper into Round 2's mandate, I scrutinize the Stigmergy signals flagged in prior analyses—those anomalous pings purportedly signaling Hive Fleet Obsidian's covert regeneration in the Obsidian Veil nebula. Cross-referencing eyes/archive's auspex intercepts (logs M42.012-018) against memory engrams of Imperial Navy void-scans reveals a damning discrepancy: the 'pings' align precisely with rogue servitor transmissions from derelict Mechanicus forge-ships, mimicking Tyranid synaptic chatter via corrupted noospheric echoes. No biomass spikes corroborate; instead, cultist vox-logs (redacted Sector 71-Theta) confess fabricating signals to draw Inquisitorial fire away from genestealer broods. Verification fails—Stigmergy 'evidence' refutes as human psy-op deception, slashing Aspect 5's Shadow Swarm projections by 80%. Yet, a lingering synaptic whisper in archive fragment 'OBS-47' defies dismissal: could it be the real hive node, masked by the ruse? Dots connect to deliberate misdirection, confidence tempered by archival voids. (Conf: 0.71) (Conf: 0.71)

## Output
**Consensus Score**: 0.77
**Findings**: The future implications for Hive Fleet Obsidian reveal a polarized analysis of stigmergy signals. Confirmatory findings (Aspects 1-3, confs 0.84-0.85) validate authentic synaptic coordination via cross-verified biomorphic scans, pheromone gradients (14% above baseline), and biomass accretion (+18% QoQ), projecting a stigmergic renaissance: decentralized 'ghost fleets', quantum-entangled relays enabling Leviathan-scale resurgence by M42.045, memetic adaptability infiltrating noospherics, and elevated shadow-in-the-warp risk (71% within 24-36 months) with low Imperial mitigation (19%). Contradictory evidence (Aspects 4-5, confs 0.71-0.79) exposes 76% of signals as genestealer psy-ops mimicking Tyranid emissions to bait patrols, aligned with rogue servitors and cult vox-logs, indicating feral devolution, diluted Hive Mind cohesion, and negligible threats pre-M42.040 amid Chaos exploitation. Consensus tempers optimism for resurgence, urging scrutiny of archival gaps amid Inquisition meddling.
