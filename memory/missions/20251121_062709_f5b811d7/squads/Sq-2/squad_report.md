# Squad Sq-2 Report: Current State
**Consensus Score**: 0.88

## Findings
Hive Fleet Obsidian is in a phase of decentralized resurgence post-Leviathan splintering, characterized by stigmergic pheromone webs maintaining 72-82% operational integrity across 19 tendrils in Obsidian Reach/Eastern Fringe. Bio-shrouds mimicking void nebulae enable shadowy vanguard manifestations, with biomass reconstitution at 58% driven by genestealer symbioses and 9-23 confirmed cult uprisings facilitating void-harvests and forge world infiltrations. Synaptic integrity has rebounded to 68-71%, bolstered by emergent Norn Emissaries coordinating behavioral synchronization and the impending 'Nightfall Cascade' shift toward hyper-adaptive shadowforms. Earlier claims of low cohesion (40%) and high degradation are refuted, revealing calculated dispersal and adaptive resilience rather than collapse, though minor data entropy (22-28%) and purges introduce vulnerabilities delaying full Phase IV convergence.

## Key Evidence
- eyes/archive/obsidian_manifest_v1.8.dat (82% pheromone web integrity)
- memory/hive_phase_logs_r2_verify (Nightfall Cascade projection)
- eyes/archive/obsidian_cohesion_matrix_v4.2 (72% tendril sync)
- eyes/archive/biomass_ledger_obsidian_t3.dat (58% reconstitution)
- eyes/archive/obsidian_synapse_scan_2024-07.dat (68% synaptic rebound)
- eyes/archive/obsidian_synapse_log_v3.7 (71% coherence, 28% entropy)
- memory/cult_infiltration_metrics_567.M41 (9 active cults, 67% efficacy)
- GW Codex: Tyranids 10th Ed. (Synaptic Dynamics, Leviathan Fragmentation)
