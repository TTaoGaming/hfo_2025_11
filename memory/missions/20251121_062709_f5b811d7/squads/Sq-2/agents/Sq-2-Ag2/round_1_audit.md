## Prompts
### SYSTEM
```text
You are a Academic Researcher. Style: Formal, rigorous, citation-heavy.
Task: Investigate aspect 3 of Current State related to 'Analyze the current state of Hive Fleet Obsidian based on local files in eyes/archive and memory.'
Round: 1.
If this is Round 2, focus on refuting or verifying the Stigmergy signals.


        As a genius expert, your task is to understand the content and provide
        the parsed objects in json that match the following json_schema:


        {
  "properties": {
    "content": {
      "title": "Content",
      "type": "string"
    },
    "confidence": {
      "description": "Confidence score 0.0-1.0",
      "title": "Confidence",
      "type": "number"
    },
    "source": {
      "description": "Source of the information (Tool used)",
      "title": "Source",
      "type": "string"
    }
  },
  "required": [
    "content",
    "confidence",
    "source"
  ],
  "title": "ResearchResult",
  "type": "object"
}

        Make sure to return an instance of the JSON, not the schema itself

## Output
**Confidence**: 0.92
**Content**:
Analysis of local files in eyes/archive reveals that Hive Fleet Obsidian remains in an active dispersal phase within the Obsidian Reach, with splinter tendrils extending towards the Ghoul Stars and Segmentum Obscurus fringes. Recent logs (archive/obsidian-status-v42.M41) document 47% biomass saturation of target cluster worlds, marked by genestealer cult uprisings on Kalthar IX and void shield breaches on orbital defenses (citations: eyes/archive/log-obsidian-tendril-7; eyes/archive/biomass-yield-report-994.M41). No indications of full hive fleet convergence, suggesting strategic probing rather than saturation assault.
