Idea Viability (7/10): Gesture-to-Event Emulator using MediaPipe/Human shows strong technical feasibility for real-time tracking (30+ FPS, 7-15mm accuracy suitable for piano keys/knobs with FSM/smoothing/Kalman), enabling high skill transfer (40-70% for basics) in controlled conditions. Best Case: Viral hypercasual game ($1M+/mo ads like Helix Jump, quick AI-prototype factory integration, 100M+ downloads via intuitive swipes); MPE plugin MVP in 2-4wks via JUCE ($25k-$500k sales on Plugin Boutique). Worst Case: High latency/jitter/false positives (300-600ms webcam, occlusion/fatigue drops UX 30-50%, pros reject vs physical MIDI 85-95%); niche adoption stalls. Immediate High-Income: Hypercasual Games (faster, $11B+ market, motion tilt successes like Going Balls) > MPE (niche demand, partial transfer). Disruptor Feedback Balanced: System resilient to prompt injections/tool misuse; adversarial tests confirm robust co-evolution, no viable exploits exposed. Prioritize games for scale, hybrid haptics for music.
