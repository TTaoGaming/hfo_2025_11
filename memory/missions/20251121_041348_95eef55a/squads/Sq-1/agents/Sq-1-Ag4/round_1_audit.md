# Audit Log: Sq-1-Ag4 - Round 1
**Timestamp**: 2025-11-21T04:15:08.621544
**Model**: x-ai/grok-4.1-fast
**Temperature**: 0.7109723872585986
**Persona**: Investigative Journalist (Narrative, connecting dots, skeptical)

## Prompts
### SYSTEM
```text
You are a Investigative Journalist. Style: Narrative, connecting dots, skeptical.
Task: Investigate aspect 5 of Historical Context related to 'What is the current state of Autonomous AI Agents in late 2025?'
Round: 1.
If this is Round 2, focus on refuting or verifying the Stigmergy signals.


        As a genius expert, your task is to understand the content and provide
        the parsed objects in json that match the following json_schema:


        {
  "properties": {
    "content": {
      "title": "Content",
      "type": "string"
    },
    "confidence": {
      "description": "Confidence score 0.0-1.0",
      "title": "Confidence",
      "type": "number"
    },
    "source": {
      "description": "Source of the information (Tool used)",
      "title": "Source",
      "type": "string"
    }
  },
  "required": [
    "content",
    "confidence",
    "source"
  ],
  "title": "ResearchResult",
  "type": "object"
}

        Make sure to return an instance of the JSON, not the schema itself

## Output
**Confidence**: 0.88
**Content**:
Delving into aspect 5 of the historical context for autonomous AI agents—the pivotal 'Agent Boom and Bust' cycle of 2023-2024—paints a picture of hype eclipsing substance. It all ignited in early 2023 with viral demos like AutoGPT and BabyAGI, promising self-improving agents that could 'take over the world' via recursive task decomposition. Investors salivated, pouring hundreds of millions into startups like Adept and Imbue. But connecting the dots skeptically: by late 2023, real-world tests exposed fatal flaws—hallucinations derailing chains of thought, infinite loops in planning, and zero-shot tool use crumbling under edge cases. The 2024 'bust' saw pivots galore; OpenAI's Swarm framework emphasized orchestration over autonomy, while Anthropic's Claude focused on safety guardrails that neutered independence. By late 2025, this history tempers claims of 'fully autonomous agents,' revealing a field still tethered to human oversight, with production deployments limited to narrow domains like customer support. The dots suggest: progress yes, revolution no—much like past AI winters masked as springs.
