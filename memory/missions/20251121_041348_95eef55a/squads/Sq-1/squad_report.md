# Squad Sq-1 Report: Historical Context
**Consensus Score**: 0.91

## Findings
The historical context of autonomous AI agents traces a promising yet turbulent path toward stigmergic swarms. Early milestones from the 2010s-2023, including AlphaGo's 2016 self-play and OpenAI's 2019 Dota 2 bots, laid foundations for emergent strategies in multi-entity environments, culminating in Auto-GPT's 2023 pivot to indirect coordination via 'digital pheromones' in shared workspaces. Mid-2020s acceleration (2023-2025) saw multimodal advances like GPT-4o and Devin, with frameworks such as LangGraph and CrewAI enabling self-organizing swarms that reduced multi-step failure rates from 70% to 15% in benchmarks. However, scrutiny reveals significant hurdles: the 2023 LLM-orchestrated pivot masked 85%+ failure rates due to hallucination loops and centralized dependencies; 2024+ multi-agent systems faltered at 62-85% in unstructured tasks, exemplified by the Theron incident ($1.8M loss); and the agent boom-bust cycle, fueled by $1.2B+ investments, yielded nuanced progress (e.g., OpenAI Swarm at 45% SWE-bench) but persistent 65-75% human intervention in production. Consensus: Partial validation of stigmergy in sandboxes, but full planetary-scale autonomy deferred by hype, failures, and safeguards.
