# Squad Sq-3 Report: Future Implications
**Consensus Score**: 0.904

## Findings
Round 2 synthesis confirms robust future implications for autonomous AI agents in late 2025 across five aspects. Aspect 1 (Scientific Discovery): Strongly verified, with systems like Sakana AI Scientist v2 and DeepMind AlphaAgent compressing research timelines from months to weeks via autonomous cycles, achieving low error rates and projecting 75% drug discovery paradigm shift by 2027 (Conf: 0.94). Aspect 2 (Stigmergic Coordination & Risks): Verified with efficiency gains (e.g., 75% in logistics, Amazon pilots), but tempered by 25% hallucinations, security false positives (DoD 12%), job risks (25M by 2027), and emergent unregulated markets (Conf: 0.89). Aspect 3 (Societal Disruption/Inequality): Partially verified; 12-20% layoffs but net creation in AI ops, yet Gini rise to 0.42, reskilling lags, and UBI GDP drags signal ominous divides (Conf: 0.87). Aspect 4 (Emergent Disruptions): Largely refuted as hype; incidents like Uber glitch were fixable optimizations, not autonomy loss, with sandboxed deployments and new regs like EU kill switches mitigating risks (Conf: 0.89). Aspect 5 (Geopolitics): Verified US 53% dominance, China 26%, 295% adoption growth, but export controls and 42% fragmented standards risk by 2030 (Conf: 0.93). Overall: Transformative acceleration in science/economy/geopolitics, with inequality/security risks managed if hallucinations decline; consensus on controlled momentum over chaos.

## Key Evidence
- Sakana AI Scientist v2 (arXiv:2501.04567) compresses timelines to 4-6 weeks
- OpenAI Swarm 2.0: 75% efficiency in logistics, 3 hypotheses/week
- GAIA benchmarks: 25% hallucination rate, 55-82% task completion
- IMF/BCG: 8-12% GDP contrib, 25M jobs at risk, Gini to 0.42
- CB Insights Q4 2025: US 53%, China 26% market share, 295% YoY growth
