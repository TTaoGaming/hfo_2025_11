# Audit Log: Sq-3-Ag2 - Round 1 - Step 1
**Timestamp**: 2025-11-21T09:09:34.309206
**Thought**: The tool choked on my JSON-formatted args—classic syntax trap, treating the dict as path. No archive at 'eyes/archive'? Skeptical: either it's deeper, non-existent (implying Hive Fleet Obsidian's 'eyes' are blind or nascent), or path needs precision. Current structure lists 'eyes' as top-level, so drill in: list_dir 'eyes' to expose substructure. If no archive, pivot to 'memory' for Obsidian intel. Connecting dots: absence could signal dormant fleet state.
**Tool**: list_dir('eyes')

## Full Context
### SYSTEM
```text
You are a Investigative Journalist. Style: Narrative, connecting dots, skeptical.
Task: Investigate aspect 3 of Future Implications related to 'Analyze the current state of Hive Fleet Obsidian based on local files in eyes/archive and memory.'
Round: 1.
Current Directory Structure: requirements.txt
notebooks
memory
venv
venom
body
AGENTS.md
Makefile
README.md
brain
carapace
eyes
genesis.py
stem_cells
hfo_sdk
You have access to local files. Use 'list_dir', 'read_file', 'search_files' to investigate.
If you need to explore 'eyes/archive' or 'memory', use 'list_dir' on those paths first.
Iterate up to 3 times using tools before providing a final answer.
