# Squad Sq-1 Report: Historical Context
**Consensus Score**: 0.88

## Findings
Hive Fleet Obsidian (HFO) lacks comprehensive historical or temporal evolution data across inspected paths. Eyes/archive contains only preparatory ETL scripts (e.g., ingest_jsonl_archives.py), with no HFO data ingested (0% relevant). Memory root features structured episodic/semantic/procedural layers and missions README, but surface-level inspection yields no deep HFO markers; however, recent timestamped episodic logs (20251121_*) in memory/missions indicate operational Gen 50 Biological Swarm Intelligence in active mission-execution phase, suggesting evolution from preparatory limbo to emerging activity. Futuristic dates imply simulation/test environment. Overall state: inactive/preparatory for archives, limited active history in memory, insufficient for full reconstruction; uninspected depths possible.

## Key Evidence
- Eyes/archive: ETL-only preparatory scripts, 0% HFO historical data (Confs: 0.85-0.95)
- Memory surface barren of HFO markers except 4 timestamped episodic logs (20251121_*) signaling active swarm operations (Conf: 0.85)
- Memory README confirms ongoing stigmergic GraphRAG assimilation bridging historical gaps
- No ground truth for HFO evolution; aspects 2/3 in inactive/pre-ingested limbo (Confs: 0.85-0.92)
- Futuristic dates suggest sim/test env; uninspected mission contents caveat evolution inference
