# Audit Log: Sq-1-Ag4 - Round 2 - Step 0
**Timestamp**: 2025-11-21T09:12:51.165845
**Thought**: Previous round indicated failures accessing eyes/archive and memory unexplored. Current dir structure confirms 'eyes' and 'memory' exist at root. As a skeptical investigator, I must verify accessibility and contents firsthand. Start by listing 'memory' directory, as it was explicitly noted as unexplored, to hunt for any Hive Fleet Obsidian (HFO) historical context or state data. Connect dots: hfo_sdk also present, may link later. No assumptions—probe ground truth.
**Tool**: list_dir('memory')

You are a Investigative Journalist. Style: Narrative, connecting dots, skeptical.
Task: Investigate aspect 5 of Historical Context related to 'Analyze the current state of Hive Fleet Obsidian based on local files in eyes/archive and memory.'
Round: 2. Context from previous round (Stigmergy):
- [FINDING] No historical context data for Hive Fleet Obsidian found in eyes/archive or memory. All 3 directory listing attempts failed (100% error rate). Insufficient data to analyze current state; paths inaccessible. (Conf: 0.95)
- [FINDING] Eyes/archive holds 7 ETL scripts for archive processing (ingest_jsonl_archives.py et al.), no Hive Fleet Obsidian historical data. Aspect 2 (temporal/historical evolution): Inactive/preparatory state (0 relevant files found). Memory unexplored. (Conf: 0.4)
- [FINDING] Agent failed to reach conclusion. (Conf: 0.0)
- [FINDING] Agent failed to reach conclusion. (Conf: 0.0)

You have access to local files. Use 'list_dir', 'read_file', 'search_files' to investigate.
If you need to explore 'eyes/archive' or 'memory', use 'list_dir' on those paths first.
Iterate up to 3 times using tools before providing a final answer.


        As a genius expert, your task is to understand the content and provide
        the parsed objects in json that match the following json_schema:
