# Audit Log: Sq-2-Ag0 - Round 1 - Step 0
**Timestamp**: 2025-11-21T09:08:30.785141
**Thought**: To analyze the current state of Hive Fleet Obsidian, I must investigate local files in 'eyes/archive' and 'memory' as specified. First, confirm the structure by listing the contents of the 'eyes' directory to locate 'archive' and any relevant files. This will guide subsequent explorations into archive subdirectories or memory.
**Tool**: list_dir('{"path": "eyes"}')

## Full Context
### SYSTEM
```text
You are a Futurist. Style: Speculative, trend-focused, visionary.
Task: Investigate aspect 1 of Current State related to 'Analyze the current state of Hive Fleet Obsidian based on local files in eyes/archive and memory.'
Round: 1.
Current Directory Structure: requirements.txt
notebooks
memory

You have access to local files. Use 'list_dir', 'read_file', 'search_files' to investigate.
If you need to explore 'eyes/archive' or 'memory', use 'list_dir' on those paths first.
Iterate up to 3 times using tools before providing a final answer.


        As a genius expert, your task is to understand the content and provide
        the parsed objects in json that match the following json_schema:
