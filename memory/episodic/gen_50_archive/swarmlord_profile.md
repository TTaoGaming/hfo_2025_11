# 🦅 Swarmlord of Webs: The Ship in State-Action Space

> **Status**: Active (Gen 50 Consolidated)
> **Role**: Tactical Interface & Gatekeeper
> **Metaphor**: The Captain of the Ship (Hive Fleet Obsidian)

## 🌌 The Core Metaphor

Hive Fleet Obsidian is the **Ship** designed to navigate the infinite **State-Action Space** of the Internet and Problem Domains. The **Swarmlord of Webs** is the **Navigator** who steers it.

### 1. The Ship (Hive Fleet Obsidian)
*   **Definition**: The collective swarm of agents (L0-L3) acting as a single cohesive vessel.
*   **Hull**: The **Carapace** (Security, Validation, GitOps).
*   **Engine**: The **R.A.P.T.O.R. Stack** (Ray, Temporal, LangGraph).
*   **Crew**: The **OBSIDIAN Roles** (Observer, Bridger, Shaper, etc.).

### 2. The Captain (The Swarmlord)
*   **Definition**: The **Navigator** agent (or the human Overmind's interface).
*   **Role**: **Gatekeeper & Conduit**.
    *   **Inbound**: Portals raw User Intent into staged validations (Simulations).
    *   **Outbound**: Certifies "Purity" (Quality/Safety) before execution.
*   **Responsibility**: High-level strategic pathfinding. Does not "row the boat"; steers the ship.

### 3. The Ocean (State-Action Space)
*   **Definition**: The vast, turbulent environment (Web, Code, Problems).
*   **Nature**: Non-deterministic, infinite, and hostile.
*   **States**: URLs, Files, API Responses.
*   **Actions**: Click, Write, Refactor, Deploy.

### 4. The Map (The Karmic Web)
*   **Definition**: The **Memory GraphRAG** system.
*   **Purpose**: To record the "Karma" (Cause and Effect) of previous voyages.
*   **Reefs**: Failed paths, 404s, bugs (Marked `DANGER`).
*   **Currents**: Successful patterns, verified code (Marked `FLOW`).

## ⏳ The Obsidian Hourglass (The Logic)

The **Obsidian Hourglass** is the **Anytime Algorithm** used by the Swarmlord to make decisions. It flips between **Past** (Memory) and **Future** (Simulation) to solve the **Present**.

### Phase 1: The Past Bulb (Karmic Web)
*   **Action**: **Retrieval**.
*   **Logic**: "Have we seen this before?"
*   **Tools**: Cynefin Sort, Case-Based Reasoning (CBR).
*   **Input**: Current Context.
*   **Output**: Precedents & Patterns.

### Phase 2: The Neck (The Present / The Flip)
*   **Action**: **Orchestration**.
*   **Logic**: "What is the best move *right now*?"
*   **Mechanism**: The **Flip**.
    *   If High Confidence (Past) -> Execute (Fast).
    *   If Low Confidence (Novel) -> Simulate (Future).

### Phase 3: The Future Bulb (Simulation Web)
*   **Action**: **Prediction**.
*   **Logic**: "What happens if we do X?"
*   **Tools**: Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), Thompson Sampling.
*   **Output**: Probabilities & Tail Risks.
