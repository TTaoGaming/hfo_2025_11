# Stigmergy Layer Connectivity Verification

## Mission Intent
Verify NATS Stigmergy Layer connectivity.

## Analysis
- **NATS**: High-performance, open-source messaging system for cloud-native applications, microservices, etc.
- **Stigmergy Layer**: Likely a distributed communication layer inspired by stigmergy (indirect coordination via environment), using NATS for pub/sub messaging.
- **Verification Steps (Planned)**:
  1. Check NATS server availability.
  2. Test connection from this agent.
  3. Publish/subscribe test messages.
  4. Confirm Stigmergy-specific endpoints.

## Status
**Pending** - Initial setup complete.
