# 🦋 HFO Metamorphosis: Organ Renaming Plan (Plain English)

> **Status**: Proposal
> **Objective**: Rename the physical directory structure to simple, layperson-friendly biological terms.

## 🧬 The Body Anatomy

We rename the folders to parts of a body. This makes the system intuitive: "Where is the strategy?" -> "In the Brain." "Where are the tools?" -> "In the Hands."

| Current Path | New Path | Biological Function | Guardian Role |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`intent/`** | **`brain/`** | **Thinking**: Strategy, Plans, Will. | **Navigator** |
| **`ingestion/`** | **`eyes/`** | **Seeing**: Data intake, Sensing. | **Observer** |
| **`memory/`** | **`memory/`** | **Remembering**: Long-term storage. | **Assimilator** |
| **`docs/`** | **`carapace/`** | **Protecting**: Documentation, Standards. | **Immunizer** |
| **`tests/`** | **`acid/`** | **Testing**: Stress testing, breaking things down. | **Disruptor** |
| **`src/`** | **`body/`** | **Being**: The main organism code. | *Collective* |
| **`src/swarm/`** | **`body/nerves/`** | **Feeling**: Coordination, Signals, Logic. | **Bridger** |
| **`src/tools/`** | **`body/hands/`** | **Doing**: Tools, Actions, Scripts. | **Shaper** |
| **`src/config/`** | **`body/blood/`** | **Fueling**: Resources, Settings, DNA. | **Injector** |

## 🏗️ Migration Steps

1.  **Approve**: Confirm these "Plain English" names.
2.  **Rename**: Execute `mv` commands.
3.  **Refactor**: Update `registry.yaml` and code imports.
4.  **Stigmergy**: Apply headers using these simple terms (e.g., `organ: brain`).

## ❓ Questions for Swarmlord

1.  Is **`acid`** too aggressive for tests? (Alternative: **`gym`**).
2.  Is **`blood`** clear enough for config? (Alternative: **`heart`**).
3.  Is **`memory`** fine to keep as is? (It's the plainest term).
