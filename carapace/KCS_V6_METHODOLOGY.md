# Knowledge-Centered Service (KCS v6) Methodology 🧠
## For Hive Fleet Obsidian (Gen 50)

**Status:** Active Standard
**Adopted:** November 2025

### 1. Core Philosophy
In Generation 50, we shift from "Code-First" to **"Knowledge-First"**. We do not write code to solve a problem; we **search for existing knowledge** to solve the problem, and only write code if the knowledge is missing.

> **"Fix it when you find it."** — We do not scrub the entire 219MB database. We clean only what we touch.

---

### 2. The Solve Loop (Agent Workflow)
Every time you (or the AI) attempt a task, follow this cycle:

#### 🔍 1. Capture (Search & Retrieve)
*   **Action:** Before writing a single line of code, search `memory/semantic` (Vector DB) and `memory/procedural` (Old Code).
*   **Goal:** Find a precedent. Has Gen 43 done this? Has Gen 25 tried and failed?
*   **Tool:** `notebooks/00_trajectory_analysis.ipynb` or the Vector Search tool.

#### 🏗️ 2. Structure (Format)
*   **Action:** If you find a relevant snippet, do not just copy-paste. **Structure it** into our Gen 50 standards:
    *   **Behavior:** Write a Gherkin Feature (`intent/*.feature`).
    *   **Logic:** Write the Python implementation (`src/*.py`).
*   **Goal:** Convert "Raw Data" into "Structured Assets".

#### ♻️ 3. Reuse (Apply)
*   **Action:** Use the structured asset to pass the test.
*   **Metric:** "Link Rate" — How often did we solve a problem using Gen 1-50 data vs. writing from scratch?

#### 🔧 4. Improve (Refine)
*   **Action:** If the retrieved memory was "AI Slop" (buggy, hallucinated, or inefficient):
    *   **Do NOT ignore it.**
    *   **Flag it:** Move the bad JSONL/Snippet to `memory/episodic/raw_audit_logs/quarantine/`.
    *   **Fix it:** Update the concept in the active workspace.

---

### 3. The Evolve Loop (System Growth)
This is the background process that keeps the memory healthy.

#### 🛡️ Content Health
*   **State: `Draft`** → New code generated by Gen 50.
*   **State: `Approved`** → Code that passes `pytest-bdd`.
*   **State: `Legacy`** → The Gen 1-50 artifacts in `memory/`. Read-only reference.
*   **State: `Archived`** → Proven failures.

#### 📊 Process Integration
*   Our **Definition of Done** includes updating the Knowledge Base.
*   A feature is not complete until the **Intent** (Gherkin) matches the **Implementation** (Python).

### 4. Practical Folder Mapping

| KCS Concept | HFO Folder | Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Knowledge Base (KB)** | `memory/semantic/` | **Search Here First.** |
| **Incident Logs** | `memory/episodic/` | **Check for Past Failures.** |
| **Solution Article** | `src/` + `intent/` | **Create/Update Here.** |
| **Archive** | `ingestion/archive/` | **Move Junk Here.** |

---

### 5. The "Flag It" Protocol
If you encounter a file in `memory/` that is clearly garbage ("AI Slop"):
1.  **Do not delete it.** (Negative data is useful).
2.  **Move it** to `memory/episodic/raw_audit_logs/slop_quarantine/`.
3.  **Log it** in `docs/DATA_QUALITY_LOG.md`.
