# Hive Fleet Obsidian: Generation 59 (Evolution)

This generation builds upon the stable "Holographic Quorum" of Generation 58.

## Structure
This generation maintains the 8-fold Octree structure derived from Generation 57:

1. **blood/**
2. **brain/**
3. **effectors/**
4. **immune_system/**
5. **memory/**
6. **nerves/**
7. **sensors/**
8. **venom/**

## Intent
To rebuild and stabilize the system free from "AI slop" and corruption.

## Philosophy: The Law of Canalization
> "The fundamental error is that AI agents follow the path of least resistance. Without enough guardrails and CANALIZATION, the AI will always default to AI slop."

See [brain/design_canalization.md](brain/design_canalization.md) for the full protocol.

## Progress Log

### 2025-11-28: The Holographic Quorum (PREY 8888)
We have successfully implemented and verified the **PREY 8888 Holographic Quorum** workflow, enforcing strict "Canalization" to prevent AI slop.

*   **Architecture**: 8 Agents x 8 Pillars (Ontos, Logos, Telos, Chronos, Pathos, Ethos, Topos, Nomos).
*   **Trust Model**:
    *   **Family Cap**: Max 2 models per provider (Enforced).
    *   **Zero Trust**: Level 0 Artifacts capped at **0.5** confidence.
    *   **Byzantine Assumption**: Level 1 Consensus capped at **0.75**.
*   **Verification**:
    *   Ingested `design_obsidian_spider_manifesto.md`.
    *   Audited `memory/hfo_memory.db` via `brain/audit_db.py`.
    *   **Result**: 100% Compliance. 8 Agents, 0.5 Confidence, 0.75 Consensus.
