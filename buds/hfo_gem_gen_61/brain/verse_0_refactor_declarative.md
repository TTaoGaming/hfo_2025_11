# 🕷️ Verse 0: The Declarative Refactor

> **Insight**: The User correctly identified that the previous lines were **Imperative** (Commands: "Spawn", "Ignite").
> **Goal**: Shift to **Declarative** (States/Entities: "Swarms", "Inputs").
> **Constraint**: Maintain 8 Syllables, Acrostic O.B.S.I.D.I.A.N., and the Rhyme.

## 📊 Comparison

| Letter | Pillar | Imperative (Current) | Declarative (Proposed Noun Shift) | Syllables (Prop) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **O** | Observer | `One Fractal Seed to rule the Eight` | `Given One Fractal Seed to rule the Eight` | 8 (Perfect) |
| **B** | Bridger | `Branch Eight-Fold Logic from the Gate` | `And Branches weave the Logic Gate` | 8 (Bran-ches weave the Log-ic Gate) |
| **S** | Shaper | `Spawn Agents for the Future State` | `And Swarms evolve the Future State` | 8 (Swarms e-volve the Fu-ture State) |
| **I** | Injector | `Ignite the Loop to Iterate` | `And Iterations Generate` | 8 (It-er-a-tions Gen-er-ate) |
| **D** | Disruptor | `Destroy the Flaw to Elevate` | `And Disruptors purge to Elevate` | 8 (Dis-rup-tors purge to El-e-vate) |
| **I** | Immunizer | `Impose the Law to Isolate` | `And Immunity will Isolate` | 8 (Im-mu-ni-ty will Is-o-late) |
| **A** | Assimilator | `Accumulate the Traits of Fate` | `And Archives hold the Traits of Fate` | 8 (Ar-chives hold the Traits of Fate) |
| **N** | Navigator | `[PENDING]` | `Then Nodes align to Liberate` | 8 (Nodes a-lign to Lib-er-ate) |

## 📝 The Declarative Chant (Draft)

```gherkin
Feature: The Obsidian Octet (Verse 0)
  Scenario: The State of the Web
    Given One Fractal Seed to rule the Eight
    And Branches weave the Logic Gate
    And Swarms evolve the Future State
    And Iterations Generate
    And Disruptors purge to Elevate
    And Immunity will Isolate
    And Archives hold the Traits of Fate
    Then Nodes align to Liberate
```

## 🧠 Analysis
*   **Imperative**: "Do this!" (Script/Command).
*   **Declarative**: "This is true." (Law/Constitution).
*   **Verdict**: The Declarative Noun Shift fits the "Manifesto" vibe much better. It describes the *nature* of the Obsidian Spider, not just its actions.
