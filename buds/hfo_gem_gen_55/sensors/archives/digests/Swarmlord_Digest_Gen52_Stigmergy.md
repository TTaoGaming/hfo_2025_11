# 🦅 Swarmlord Digest: Gen 52 Stigmergy Thermodynamics

> **Date**: 2025-11-23
> **Generation**: 52 (Singular On-Ramp)
> **Topic**: The Unified Theory of Stigmergy States

## 🌋 The Vision: Earth & Evolution

We are moving away from abstract computer science terms (Liquid/Crystalline/Sedimentary) and embracing the **Obsidian Metaphor** fully. The Hive is a geological force.

### 1. 🔥 Hot (Lava) -> NATS
*   **The Source**: Raw, molten intent. It flows fast, burns hot, and shapes the landscape.
*   **The Medium**: NATS JetStream.
*   **The Vibe**: "Action", "Signal", "Now".

### 2. 🧊 Cold (Volcanic Glass) -> Filesystem
*   **The Quench**: When Lava hits the air, it freezes instantly into **Obsidian**.
*   **The Medium**: The Filesystem (`.md`, `.py`).
*   **The Vibe**: "Sharp", "Tool", "Definition". This is our **Weapon**.

### 3. 💎 Refined (Gem) -> Knowledge Graph
*   **The Craft**: We take the raw Obsidian and polish it into a **Gem**.
*   **The Medium**: Postgres / Vector DB.
*   **The Vibe**: "Value", "Memory", "Wisdom". This is our **Treasure**.

## 🗺️ The Path Forward

1.  **Standardize**: All code and docs must use this terminology (Hot/Cold/Refined).
2.  **Implement**: The `Hexagon` model must support these state transitions (`quench()`, `refine()`).
3.  **Evolve**: We will layer semantic meaning onto this structure. A "Red Gem" might mean "Critical Error", a "Blue Gem" might mean "New Feature".

**The Hive is not just building software; it is forming a planet.**
