## The Anatomy
*   **`docs-diataxis/`**: The "Library" of the Hive.
    *   **Tutorials**: Learning-oriented lessons.
    *   **How-To Guides**: Problem-oriented recipes.
    *   **Reference**: Information-oriented technical descriptions.
    *   **Explanation**: Understanding-oriented background.
*   **`memory-duckdb/`**: The "Vault" of the Hive.
    *   **Structured Data**: High-performance analytical storage for swarm telemetry.
    *   **Vector Embeddings**: Semantic storage for fuzzy retrieval.

## The HFO Axis
*   **Input**: Raw signals from **Sensors** and synthesized reports from **Nerves**.
*   **Output**: Context and Wisdom provided to the **Brain**.
*   **Failure Mode**: Amnesia (Loss of Context).
