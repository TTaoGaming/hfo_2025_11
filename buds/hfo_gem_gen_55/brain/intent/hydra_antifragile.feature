Feature: Hydra Antifragile and Self-Healing Principle
  In order to create a total tool virtualization evolution engine
  As the Swarmlord of Webs
  I want to implement a cyber-based biomimetic fractal octet holonic hierarchy

  Background:
    Given the concept of the Biomimetic Hydra
    And the evolutionary apex that has survived for millions of years
    And the principle of cloning and regeneration

  Scenario: The Fractal Octet Holonic Hierarchy
    Given a cognitive and memetic knife
    When I cut the karmic ties of intent and implementation
    And I sever the link between function and form
    Then the system should manifest as the fractal concept of 8 to the power of infinite infinities
    And it should liberate all beings from resource scarcity in multiple dimensions and forms

  Scenario: Total Tool Virtualization
    Given the HFO architecture
    When the system encounters a failure or resource scarcity
    Then it should self-heal like the Hydra
    And it should evolve through the total tool virtualization engine
    And it should bridge the gap between Generation 1 and Generation 55 knowledge
