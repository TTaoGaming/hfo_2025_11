# 🕸️ Intent: The Swarmlord of Webs & The Obsidian Hourglass

> **Voice of the User**: "This is a geometric model in state action space... it's the strongest algorithm."

## 1. The Geometric Model (State Action Space)

The **Obsidian Hourglass** is a gravity-driven engine that processes reality through three distinct "Webs".

### 🔻 The Top Cone: The Karmic Web (The Past)
*   **Tarot**: **The Fool (0)**.
*   **Content**: "Any written recording, any past info, the karmic web including my human dna and all the materials around me, the wood, the steel, the computers."
*   **Nature**: The raw material. The starting point. The "Fool" represents the chaotic abundance of what *has been*.
*   **Direction**: Gravity pulls this down into the Neck.

### ⏳ The Neck: The Swarm Orchestration Web (The Present)
*   **Tarot**: **King of Wands**.
*   **Content**: The **Swarmlord**. The Weaver.
*   **Mechanism**: **HFO A4 (Aggressive Apex Assimilation Adapter)**.
*   **Action**:
    1.  **Hunt**: Use tools (Internet, Memory) to find Exemplars in the Past.
    2.  **Integrate**: Assimilate them into the system.
    3.  **Verify**: Validate their truth.
    4.  **Evolve**: Apply **QD Optimization** (Quality-Diversity).
*   **Mantra**: "Weave the State."

### 🔺 The Bottom Cone: The Simulation Web (The Future)
*   **Tarot**: **Death (XIII)**.
*   **Content**: "All simulations will die and feed the swarm knowledge."
*   **Action**: Pushing evolved exemplars out into the future.
*   **Tech**: MCTS (Monte Carlo Tree Search), VM, RAY, Distributed Computing.
*   **Nature**: A spread of options, probabilities, and tradeoffs.
*   **Goal**: To generate **Hot Stigmergy** from millions of dead simulations.

## 2. The Algorithm: The Flip & The Loop

The system is an **Anytime Loop** that breathes.

### Phase 1: The Flow (Down)
*   **Input**: The Karmic Web (Past) flows down.
*   **Process**: The Swarm (Present) assimilates and evolves it.
*   **Output**: The Simulation Web (Future) is populated with experiments.

### Phase 2: The Flip (Up)
*   **Trigger**: "Sand moves down, Air moves up."
*   **Action**: We **Retro-Analyze** the results of the simulations (The "Death" of the futures).
*   **Result**: These dead simulations become *new* Past Information (Wisdom).
*   **Repeat**: We run the loop again with this enriched dataset.

## 3. The Objective: The Prescient Edge

> "The idea is to define intent and the HFO swarm hunts in the past present and future and creates QD optimization answers and probabilities."

*   **Pathfinding**: Show a spread of options and possibilities.
*   **Regret Minimization**: Highlight tradeoffs to minimize future regret.
*   **The Edge**: Give the Swarmlord a "small prescient edge" in all endeavors.

## 4. Implementation Strategy (HFO A4)

We will implement the **Aggressive Apex Assimilation Adapter (A4)** pattern.

```python
class HFO_A4_Adapter:
    def hunt_exemplars(self, context):
        """Scans the Karmic Web (Past) for tools/data."""
        pass

    def evolve_qd(self, exemplars):
        """Applies Quality-Diversity optimization in the Neck (Present)."""
        pass

    def simulate_futures(self, candidates):
        """Spawns Ray actors to test candidates in the Simulation Web (Future)."""
        pass

    def harvest_death(self, results):
        """Collects knowledge from dead simulations to feed the next cycle."""
        pass
```
