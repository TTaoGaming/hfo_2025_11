# 🦅 Intention: The Gen 55 Swarmlord Protocol

> **Authority**: Swarmlord of Webs
> **Mandate**: Establish the "Trinity of Workflows" for Hive Fleet Obsidian.

## 1. The Trinity
The Hive Fleet operates on three distinct scales of cognition. Each scale has a specific workflow pattern that must be strictly adhered to.

### 🟢 Pattern 1: The Atomic Unit (1-1-1-1 PREY)
*   **Scope**: Individual Agent / Low Resource (Chromebook).
*   **Use Case**: Simple tasks, sequential logic, linear execution.
*   **Structure**: Observer -> Bridger -> Shaper -> Assimilator.
*   **Stigmergy**: Hot Loop (NATS).

### 🟡 Pattern 2: The Fractal Squad (8-8-8-8 PREY)
*   **Scope**: High Concurrency / Adversarial Testing.
*   **Use Case**: Robust decision making, antifragility, "Red Teaming".
*   **Structure**: 8 Parallel Agents per phase with Hidden Disruptors.
*   **Stigmergy**: Hot Loop (NATS) + Probabilistic Spread.

### 🔴 Pattern 3: The Diamond Swarm (1-8-64-8-1)
*   **Scope**: Strategic Campaign / Massive Scale.
*   **Use Case**: Complex missions requiring domain decomposition and massive parallel execution.
*   **Structure**: Commander -> 8 Squads -> 64 Workers -> 8 Synthesizers -> Apex.
*   **Stigmergy**: Cold Loop (LanceDB).

## 2. The Integration
*   **Lvl 0**: The **1-1-1-1** agents are the hands.
*   **Lvl 1**: The **8-8-8-8** squads are the arms.
*   **Lvl 2**: The **1-8-64-8-1** swarm is the body.

All patterns share the same **Hexagonal Stigmergy Schema** and write to the same **LanceDB Memory**.
