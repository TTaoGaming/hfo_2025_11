# 🦅 Design: The Fractal Entropy Funnel

> **Context**: Gen 55 "Synapse APEX"
> **Philosophy**: Recursive Reduction of Error (Asymptotic Truth)
> **Motto**: "We never assume 100% correctness. We reduce the probability of error recursively."

## 1. The Problem: The Hallucination Horizon
Large Language Models (LLMs) are probabilistic engines. They do not output "Truth"; they output "Likelihood". Therefore, any single generation (Lvl 0) has a non-zero probability of being a hallucination or error.
*   **Assumption**: $P(Error)_{Lvl0} > 0$ (Always).

## 2. The Solution: Recursive Reduction
We cannot eliminate error, but we can reduce it by passing information through a **Fractal Funnel** of consensus and adversarial testing.

### 🔴 Level 0: High Entropy (The Raw Spark)
*   **Source**: Single Agent (1-1-1-1).
*   **State**: **Gaseous**. High volatility, high creativity, high error rate.
*   **Mechanism**: Raw Inference.
*   **Goal**: Generate *possibilities*.

### 🟡 Level 1: Medium Entropy (The Crucible)
*   **Source**: The Squad (8-8-8-8).
*   **State**: **Liquid**. Flowing, turbulent, self-correcting.
*   **Mechanism**: **Adversarial Filtering**.
    *   The **Disruptor** injects noise to stress-test the signal.
    *   The **Guards** hunt for the noise.
    *   The **Assimilators** grade the result.
*   **Result**: A **Probabilistic Spread**. We don't say "X is True". We say "X is 85% likely, Y is 15% likely".
*   **Reduction**: $P(Error)_{Lvl1} \approx P(Error)_{Lvl0} \times (1 - TrustScore)$.

### 🟢 Level 2: Low Entropy (The Crystal)
*   **Source**: The Swarm (1-8-64-8-1).
*   **State**: **Solid**. Crystallized, structured, durable.
*   **Mechanism**: **Domain Synthesis**.
    *   Cross-referencing 8 distinct Domain Digests.
    *   If the "Ontos" Squad and the "Ethos" Squad agree, the probability of error drops significantly.
*   **Result**: **Crystallized Intent**. A decision we act upon.
*   **Reduction**: $P(Error)_{Lvl2} \ll P(Error)_{Lvl1}$.

## 3. The Mathematical Model
We treat the Swarm as a **Bayesian Belief Network**.
*   **Prior**: The User's Intent.
*   **Likelihood**: The Lvl 0 Outputs.
*   **Posterior**: The Lvl 2 Consensus.

$$ P(Truth | Swarm) \propto P(Swarm | Truth) \times P(Truth) $$

By recursively applying the **PREY Loop** at higher levels of abstraction, we sharpen the posterior distribution, making the "Peak of Truth" narrower and taller with each step.
