# 🧠 Brain (The Navigator)

> **Role**: Navigator (Strategist)
> **Pillar**: Intent
> **Stigmergy Dimension**: **Telos** (Purpose, Goal, Vision)

## The Cognitive Function
The **Brain** is the seat of **Will**. It defines *why* the Hive exists and *what* it must achieve. It does not execute; it directs. It transforms abstract desire into concrete specifications.

## The Anatomy
*   **`intent-literate-gherkin/`**: The "Constitution" of the Hive.
    *   **Features**: `.feature` files written in Gherkin (Given/When/Then) that define the immutable laws and behaviors of the system.
    *   **Specs**: Literate Markdown files that bind these features to executable logic.

## The HFO Axis
*   **Input**: High-level directives from the Overmind.
*   **Output**: Verified Intent (Gherkin Features) passed to the **Nerves**.
*   **Failure Mode**: Hallucination (Drift from Intent).
