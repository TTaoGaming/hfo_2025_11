# 🕷️ The Movement of the Obsidian Spider

> **Core Truth**: The Spider does not "search" the web. The Spider "sits" and feels the **Vibration**.
> **The Terrain**: A **Higher Dimensional Semantic Manifold** (Indra's Net).
> **The Mechanism**: **Triangulation** via **Social Spider Optimization (SSO)**.

## 1. The Terrain: Indra's Net (The Manifold)
The "World" is not a flat list of files. It is a **Sparse Voxel DAG (SVDAG)** mapped onto a high-dimensional vector space (HNSW).
*   **Indra's Net**: Every node (jewel) reflects every other node.
*   **The Manifold**: Knowledge exists on a curved surface in this space. To move from "Idea A" to "Idea B", you don't fly in a straight line; you crawl along the manifold of meaning.

## 2. The Mechanism: Social Spider Optimization (SSO)
We do not use standard "Search" (A* or Dijkstra). We use **SSO**.
*   **The Web**: The NATS JetStream + The HNSW Index.
*   **The Vibration**: A Query or an Event is a "disturbance" in the manifold.
*   **The Attenuation**: The vibration decays over distance (Semantic Relevance).
*   **The Movement**:
    *   **Female Spiders (Exploit)**: Move towards the strongest vibration (The most relevant memory).
    *   **Male Spiders (Explore)**: Move towards the Female Spiders (Diversity/Mating).
    *   **The Swarm**: Converges on the "Prey" (The Answer) without needing to scan the entire web.

## 3. The Navigation: Temporal Triangulation
To know "Where" we are, we must triangulate our position using **3 Anchors**:

1.  **The Past ($Z < 0$)**: **CBR (Case-Based Reasoning)**.
    *   *Source*: LanceDB (The Iron Ledger).
    *   *Question*: "What have we done before?"
2.  **The Present ($Z = 0$)**: **Telemetry / Stigmergy**.
    *   *Source*: NATS JetStream (The Nervous System).
    *   *Question*: "What is the current state?"
3.  **The Future ($Z > 0$)**: **MCTS (Monte Carlo Tree Search)**.
    *   *Source*: The Simulation Web (Many Worlds).
    *   *Question*: "What are the likely outcomes?"

**The Result**: By triangulating these three signals, the Spider calculates the **Golden Path** (The Optimal Next Action).

## 4. The Speciation: MAP-Elites
We do not use a "One Size Fits All" agent. We use **Speciated Swarms**.
*   **MAP-Elites**: We maintain a "Grid of Species" (Quality Diversity).
    *   *Species A*: Fast/Aggressive (Good for Hot Stigmergy).
    *   *Species B*: Slow/Deep (Good for Cold Stigmergy).
    *   *Species C*: Random/Chaotic (Good for Disruption).
*   **Selection**: The Spider selects the right "Species" for the current "Vibration".
