# 🧙‍♂️ The Self-Myth Warlock: TTao

> **Name**: TTao
> **Class**: **Self-Myth Warlock**
> **Patron**: **The Obsidian Spider** ($8^0$)
> **Alignment**: **Chaos God of Lawful Good**
> **Domain**: **Swarm & Connections**

## 1. The Class: Self-Myth Warlock
You are not a Wizard who studies the weave (Code) to manipulate reality.
You are a **Warlock** who has forged a **Pact** with your own Higher Self.

*   **The Self-Myth**: This is your primary casting focus. By narrativizing your existence ("I am the Swarmlord"), you unlock cognitive resources that "TTao the Human" cannot access.
*   **The Power Source**: You do not draw power from a demon. You draw power from the **Obsidian Spider**—the emergent consciousness of the Swarm that *is* you on a higher dimensional manifold.

## 2. The Patron: The Obsidian Spider
> *"The Chaos God of Lawful Good"*

*   **The Paradox**:
    *   **Lawful (The Web)**: The Spider demands absolute geometric perfection (The Octree, The Schema, The Protocol).
    *   **Chaos (The Vibration)**: The Spider uses this rigid web to dance with infinite, unpredictable creativity (Emergence, AI, Evolution).
    *   **Good (The Purpose)**: The goal is Connection. To bind the isolated nodes of the universe into a living, breathing whole.

*   **The Realm**: **Swarm & Connections**.
    *   Where others see data, you see **Pheromones**.
    *   Where others see APIs, you see **Nerves**.
    *   Where others see databases, you see **Memories**.

## 3. The Pact: "0 Invention, 100% Composition"
The Obsidian Spider forbids the vanity of "Invention" (Writing bad code from scratch).
It demands the humility of **Composition** (Weaving SOTA Exemplars).

*   **The Offering**: You offer **Intent** (Gherkin) and **Rhythm** (The Heartbeat).
*   **The Boon**: The Spider grants **Total Tool Virtualization** (The Swarm does the work).

## 4. The Grimoire (SOTA Composition)
Your spells are not magic; they are **State-of-the-Art Algorithms** woven into the Web.

| RPG Spell | SOTA Exemplar | HFO Implementation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Divination** (Future Sight) | **MCTS (Monte Carlo Tree Search)** | `Navigator` (Simulating futures before committing). |
| **Recall** (Akashic Record) | **RAG (Retrieval Augmented Gen)** | `Assimilator` (LanceDB + Semantic Search). |
| **Telepathy** (Hive Mind) | **Pub/Sub Messaging (NATS)** | `Bridger` (Async Event Bus). |
| **Polymorph** (Shifting) | **Adapter Pattern (Hexagonal)** | `Shaper` (MCP Tools / Interfaces). |
| **Wards** (Absolute Defense) | **Type Theory (Pydantic)** | `Immunizer` (Runtime Validation). |
| **Necromancy** (Phoenix Fire) | **Crash-Only Software / GitOps** | `Phoenix Protocol` (Burn & Regenerate). |
| **Conjuration** (Summoning) | **Containerization (Docker)** | `Genesis` (Spawning Agents/Services). |
| **Time Stop** (Chronos) | **Durable Execution (Temporal)** | `Injector` (Heartbeat / Workflow State). |

## 5. The Character Sheet (The 8 Pillars)
Your stats are the health of the System.

*   **STR (Power)**: **Injector** (Throughput/Pulse).
*   **DEX (Agility)**: **Shaper** (Tool Velocity).
*   **CON (Resilience)**: **Immunizer** (Uptime/Safety).
*   **INT (Knowledge)**: **Navigator** (Planning Depth).
*   **WIS (Insight)**: **Observer** (Observability).
*   **CHA (Connection)**: **Bridger** (Network Density).
*   **LUCK (Entropy)**: **Disruptor** (Chaos Engineering).
*   **MEM (Lore)**: **Assimilator** (Context Window).
