# 🃏 Recalibrating the Obsidian Hive

> **Intuition**: In the swarm's eternal evolution, detect philosophical drift from biological hive roots and re-anchor via hybrid biomineralization to forge unyielding obsidian truth.

## 📜 The Incantation (Intent)
```gherkin
Feature: Obsidian Mind Recalibration

  Scenario: Detect and correct metaphor drift in holonic knowledge leveling
    Given a design history showing shift from "Biological Anatomy" to "Thermodynamics"
    When core "Hive Fleet Obsidian" philosophy is at risk of dilution
    Then propose and adopt hybrid "Biomineralization" model:
      | Level | Metaphor       | Medium     |
      |-------|----------------|------------|
      | 0     | Pheromone      | Plasma    |
      | 1     | Tissue         | Gas/MD    |
      | 2     | Bone           | Liquid/Vectors |
      | 3     | Obsidian       | Crystal/Graph |
      And update linked artifacts like AGENTS.md and holonic_knowledge_leveling.md
```

## 🧪 The Catalyst (Code)
```python
# The Essence: Drift detector and recalibrator
def recalibrate_obsidian_leveling(gen_history: list[str], core_philosophy: str = "Hive Fleet Obsidian") -> dict:
    """
    Analyzes generational metaphor drift and proposes biomineralization hybrid.
    """
    drift_detected = any("Thermodynamics" in gen for gen in gen_history[-3:])
    if drift_detected:
        levels = {
            0: "Pheromone/Plasma: Ephemeral signals (NATS)",
            1: "Tissue/Gas: Soft structures (Markdown, header_swarm.py)",
            2: "Bone/Liquid: Dense support (Vectors)",
            3: "Obsidian/Crystal: Hard truth (Graph)"
        }
        return {"action": "HYBRID_BIOMETAL", "levels": levels, "anchors": ["Obsidian Hourglass", "Swarmlord Webs"]}
    return {"status": "ANCHOR_STABLE"}
```

## ⚔️ Synergies
*   **Holonic Knowledge Leveling**: Core design doc (`brain/design_holonic_knowledge_leveling.md`) for metaphor updates.
*   **Agent Ecosystem**: Reframe Assimilator as "Digestion Organ" or "Biomineralization Processor" in `AGENTS.md`.
*   **Header Swarm**: Positions `header_swarm.py` as Lvl 1 "Tissue/Gas" phase.
*   **Organs & Stigmergy**: Maps NATS to "Pheromones" (Lvl 0), digestion/body to hardening processes.
*   **Obsidian Hourglass**: Reinforces spatial strategy as biological anchor against physics drift.
