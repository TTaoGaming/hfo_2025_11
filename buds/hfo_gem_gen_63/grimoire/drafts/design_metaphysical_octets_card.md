# 🃏 Metaphysical Octets

> **Intuition**: The lens defines the world, as alternative 8-fold metaphysical categorizations refract existence into dimensions tailored to systemic flavors like classical philosophy, cybernetic precision, cognitive depth, or elemental flow.

## 📜 The Incantation (Intent)
```gherkin
Feature: Adaptive Metaphysical Octets for Hive Architectures

  Scenario: Select octet lens by systemic flavor
    Given a desired Hive flavor such as "Hard Sci-Fi", "Cognitive", or "Organic"
    When structuring ontological dimensions
    Then apply the corresponding 8-fold octet mapping to Ontos, Logos, Techne, etc.
    And bridge to implementation layers like Cybernetic for code alignment
```

## 🧪 The Catalyst (Code)
```python
# The Essence
METAPHYSICAL_OCTETS = {
    'greek': {
        'Ontos': 'Being - Who are you?',
        'Logos': 'Logic - How do you connect?',
        'Techne': 'Craft - How do you build?',
        'Chronos': 'Time - When are you?',
        'Pathos': 'Emotion - How do you feel?',
        'Ethos': 'Ethics - Who do you trust?',
        'Topos': 'Place - Where are you?',
        'Telos': 'Purpose - Why are you?',
    },
    'cybernetic': {
        'Entity': 'Unit ID/State - What is the Object?',
        'Protocol': 'Interface/API - How does it talk?',
        'Function': 'Capability/Method - What does it do?',
        'Clock': 'Tick/Latency - What is the frequency?',
        'Variance': 'Error/Entropy - What is the deviation?',
        'Policy': 'ACL/Security - What is allowed?',
        'Address': 'Pointer/URI - Where is it stored?',
        'Objective': 'Reward Function - What maximizes value?',
    },
    # Jungian and Elemental similarly defined...
}

def select_octet(flavor: str) -> dict:
    """Refract metaphysics by flavor; defaults to Greek."""
    return METAPHYSICAL_OCTETS.get(flavor.lower(), METAPHYSICAL_OCTETS['greek'])
```

## ⚔️ Synergies
*   **Core Greek Octet**: Primary lens for HFO ontos/chronos/topos/telos fields in hexagon metadata.
*   **Cybernetic Mapping**: Implements philosophical dims as code primitives (e.g., Ontos → EntityID) for Python/Hive runtime.
*   **Holarchy Integration**: Links to `obsidian_holarchy.md` for nested octet structures across swarm scales.
*   **Flavor Plugins**: Jungian for agent ToM/LLM psych; Elemental for biomimetic swarm viz in buds/hfo_gem_gen_56.
*   **Recommendation Path**: Defaults to Greek for philosophy-code bridge, with others as vibe-specific overrides.
