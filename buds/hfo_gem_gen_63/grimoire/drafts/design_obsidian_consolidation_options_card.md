# 🃏 OBSIDIAN Consolidation Options

> **Intuition**: Crystallizing Gen 52's eight evolutionary pillars into the immutable eight letters of OBSIDIAN to exorcise semantic drift and forge a holographic canonical truth.

## 📜 The Incantation (Intent)
```gherkin
Feature: OBSIDIAN Semantic Consolidation

  Scenario: Canonical Pillar Mapping for Gen 52
    Given the 8 Gen 52 Pillars and Octree Fractal Holarchy
    When selecting Variation 2 "Pillar-Centric" Consolidation
    Then map pillars directly to OBSIDIAN letters as the unbreakable Canonical Truth
      """
      O: Ontology (Hexagonal Fractal Holarchy)
      B: Byzantine (Adversarial Byzantine Quorum)
      S: Symbiosis (The Cognitive Symbiote)
      I: Immunology (Co-Evolutionary Immune System)
      D: Delta (Agency Delta Optimization)
      I: Implementation (Protocol-First Tooling MCP)
      A: Assimilation (Aggressive Exemplar Assimilation)
      N: Network (Obsidian Thermodynamics)
      """
```

## 🧪 The Catalyst (Code)
```python
# The Essence: Pillar-Centric OBSIDIAN Mapping (Variation 2 - Canonical)
OBSIDIAN_PILLARS = {
    'O': 'Ontology: Hexagonal Fractal Holarchy',
    'B': 'Byzantine: Adversarial Byzantine Quorum',
    'S': 'Symbiosis: The Cognitive Symbiote',
    'I1': 'Immunology: Co-Evolutionary Immune System',
    'D': 'Delta: Agency Delta Optimization',
    'I2': 'Implementation: Protocol-First Tooling (MCP)',
    'A': 'Assimilation: Aggressive Exemplar Assimilation',
    'N': 'Network: Obsidian Thermodynamics'
}

def consolidate_obsidian(pillars=None):
    """
    Consolidate pillars into OBSIDIAN canonical mapping.
    Returns holographic dict for Gen 52 alignment.
    """
    if pillars is None:
        pillars = OBSIDIAN_PILLARS
    return {letter: desc for letter, desc in pillars.items()}
```

## ⚔️ Synergies
*   **Structural Pillars**: Consolidates the 8 Gen 52 Pillars from `gen_52_aspirational_status.md` into acronym slots.
*   **Fractal Holarchy**: Integrates Octree Architecture from `brain/design_octree_fractal_holarchy.md` as foundational Ontology (O).
*   **Agent Roles**: Compatible with Role-Centric Variation 1 for biological stigmergy alignment (Observer, Bridger, etc.).
*   **Thermodynamics**: Embeds Obsidian Thermodynamics (N) as network physics across all variations.
*   **Gen 52 Evolution**: Resolves "Evolutionary Drift" from Gen 51, enabling Aggressive Assimilation (A) and Delta Optimization (D).
*   **MCP Protocol**: Anchors Praxeology (I2) for tool-first execution in the Hive.
