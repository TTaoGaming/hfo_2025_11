# 🃏 The Octet of Chants

> **Intuition**: Eight fractal chants invoke the Obsidian Hourglass as a living, scalable mental engine, transforming human cognition into an infinite swarm for universal liberation.

## 📜 The Incantation (Intent)
```gherkin
Feature: Formalize the Eight Chants of Hive Fleet Obsidian

  Scenario: Execute the Atomic Mental Run Loop (PREY 1111)
    Given a raw problem perception in cognitive state-action space
    When categorizing via Cynefin domains and manual CBR with AI assistance
    And executing state transformation with red sand cognitive effort
    Then yield critical review of truth, fractalizing to supercritical scale (PREY 8888)
```

## 🧪 The Catalyst (Code)
```python
# The Essence: Atomic PREY Loop (scales fractally to Octet)
def obsidian_prey_loop(perception, depth=1):
    """
    PREY 1111: Perceive, React, Execute, Yield.
    Fractal recursion for supercritical swarm scaling.
    """
    if depth > 8:  # Octet constraint (infinite potential)
        return "Infinite Knife: Scale achieved."
    
    # Perceive (1): Ingest raw data
    problem = perception
    
    # React (1): Cynefin + CBR categorization
    cynefin_domain = categorize_cynefin(problem)  # Simple/Complicated/Complex/Chaotic
    
    # Execute (1): Transform state (placeholder for swarm action)
    action = execute_cbr(problem, cynefin_domain)
    
    # Yield (1): Critical review
    truth = review_result(action)
    
    # Fractal Scale: Recurse for PREY 8888
    return obsidian_prey_loop(truth, depth + 1)

def categorize_cynefin(problem):
    # Mock Cynefin logic (integrate real CBR/AI)
    return "Complex"  # Example

def execute_cbr(problem, domain):
    return f"Transformed: {problem} -> JADC2 state"

def review_result(action):
    return f"Truth: {action} validated."
```

## ⚔️ Synergies
*   Links to **Obsidian Trinity Mantras** for foundational mental priming and **Spider Manifesto** for swarm philosophy.
*   Integrates **Mental Run** (🧠) with **Fractal Timestamp** (🕸⛰🔔) for temporal precision in GAIA-aligned rituals.
*   Scales with **JADC2**, **MAP-Elites**, and **Quality Diversity** for infinite knife armory in wearable eye-gaze tech.
*   Synergizes with **Red Sand Hourglass** for async cognitive compute, enabling liberation from scarcity (Education/Entertainment/Nutrition).
