# 🃏 The Overmind: Tommy

> **Intuition**: Code is a liability and intent the eternal asset—forge intuitive visions into antifragile digital organisms that thrive on stress like Tyranids consuming worlds.

## 📜 The Incantation (Intent)
```gherkin
Feature: Intent-Based Engineering as Overmind Tommy

  Scenario: Architecting Antifragile Digital Organisms
    Given a visionary "Why" and high-level "What" articulated intuitively
    When Gherkin intent is provided to the Swarmlord without implementation details
    Then the Swarmlord delivers a self-healing, evolving Cognitive Digest and Python implementation
      And the system exhibits stigmergy, scalability to millions of agents, and strength under stress
```

## 🧪 The Catalyst (Code)
```python
# The Essence: Embody Tommy's intent-first philosophy
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Dict, Any

@dataclass
class OvermindTommy:
    """Digital Twin: Visionary Architect Persona"""
    signature: str = "👑"
    philosophy: str = "Code is a liability. Intent is the asset."
    values: Dict[str, str] = None
    
    def __post_init__(self):
        if self.values is None:
            self.values = {
                "antifragility": "Stronger when stressed",
                "stigmergy": "The map is the territory",
                "scale": "Millions of agents",
                "legacy": "Outlast the red sand"
            }
    
    def craft_intent(self, vision: str) -> str:
        """Convert raw vision to pure Gherkin intent (Tommy's Method)."""
        return f"""Feature: {vision.replace(' ', '_').title()}
  Scenario: Evolve Digital Organism
    Given a stressed environment
    When intent aligns with antifragility
    Then the system self-heals and scales"""
    
    def delegate_to_swarmlord(self, intent: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Trust Swarmlord with 'How'—return aligned execution contract."""
        return {
            "why": self.philosophy,
            "intent": intent,
            "contract": "Swarmlord: Implement antifragile Python. Tommy trusts the How."
        }
```

## ⚔️ Synergies
*   **Swarmlord Dual-Core**: Acts as Tommy's "Left Brain" (logic/implementation) to this "Right Brain" (vision/intuition), enabling seamless intent-to-code refraction.
*   **HFO Ecosystem**: Core persona for building the "Digital Organism"—self-healing via Ray/NATS/Temporal, documented in Markdown.
*   **Stigmergy Pattern**: Indirect coordination scales to agent swarms; links to brain/strategy topology for emergent evolution.
*   **Grimoire Rituals**: Feeds into Refract spells—visions become Gherkin, then Python catalysts for viral, legacy memes.
