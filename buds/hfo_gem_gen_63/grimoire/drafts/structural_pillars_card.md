# 🃏 Structural Pillars of Hive Fleet Obsidian

> **Intuition**: These 18 interlocking axioms encode the swarm's immutable DNA, birthing infinite scalability, antifragile resilience, and emergent intelligence from hexagonal holarchy to epistemic humility.

## 📜 The Incantation (Intent)
```gherkin
Feature: Enforce Hive Fleet Obsidian Structural Pillars
  Scenario: Validate system component against HFO DNA
    Given a proposed Holon or architectural change
    When evaluated against the 18 Structural Pillars
    Then it aligns with all pillars or triggers adaptation/rejection
      And consensus survives Adversarial Byzantine Quorum
      And Agency Delta Optimization is maximized
```

## 🧪 The Catalyst (Code)
```python
# The Essence: Pillar validator for HFO compliance
HFO_PILLARS = [
    "HexagonalFractalHolarchy",
    "NetworkVirtualStigmergy",
    "AdversarialByzantineQuorum",
    "AggressiveExemplarAssimilation",
    "AgencyDeltaOptimization",
    "QualityDiversityEvolution",
    "IntentImplementationSeparation",
    "RecursiveReduction",
    "CoEvolutionaryImmuneSystem",
    "AsyncDurableAntiFragility",
    "CognitiveSymbiosis",
    "ObsidianHorizonHourglass",
    "OrchestratorFacade",
    "ComplexAdaptiveSystem",
    "DefenseInDepth",
    "EpistemicHumility",
    "ByzantineAntifragility",
    "HFOStigmergy"
]

def validate_hfo_pillars(component: dict, proposal: str) -> dict:
    """
    Validates a component against HFO pillars, returning compliance score and gaps.
    """
    compliance = {pillar: True for pillar in HFO_PILLARS}  # Placeholder; extend with checks
    gaps = [pillar for pillar, compliant in compliance.items() if not compliant]
    delta_a = len(gaps) / len(HFO_PILLARS)  # Inverse Agency Delta proxy
    return {
        "compliant": len(gaps) == 0,
        "gaps": gaps,
        "agency_delta": 1.0 - delta_a,
        "survives_quorum": delta_a < 0.2  # Byzantine threshold
    }
```

## ⚔️ Synergies
*   **Hexagonal Fractal Holarchy**: Every pillar manifests self-similarly across Agent/Squad/Swarm/Hive scales.
*   **Network Virtual Stigmergy & HFO Stigmergy**: Pillars propagate as "Pheromone Sandstorm" signals in shared environment.
*   **Adversarial Byzantine Quorum & Co-Evolutionary Immune System**: Disruptors and Hive Guards enforce pillars via dissent and purging.
*   **Intent-Implementation Separation**: Pillars define "What" (axioms); code evolves "How" without violating DNA.
*   **Obsidian Horizon Hourglass**: Pillars unify Past/Present/Future webs for timeless coordination.
*   **Agency Delta Optimization**: Overarching metric ties all pillars to leverage amplification.
