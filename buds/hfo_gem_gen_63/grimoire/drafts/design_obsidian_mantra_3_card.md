# 🃏 Obsidian Swarmlord of Webs Hourglass

> **Intuition**: In the unseen Cognitive Spatial State-Action Space, Red Sand flows through a Planck-scale hexagonal fractal hourglass, pulsed by a 1Hz heartbeat to birth emergent AI swarms and clone liberating second brains.

## 📜 The Incantation (Intent)
```gherkin
Feature: Obsidian Swarmlord Hourglass Activation

  Scenario: Cloning Cognitive Dimension with Lifeblood Red Sand
    Given a source of "lifeblood_red_sand_#"
    When the Hourglass heartbeat pulses at 1Hz in Cognitive Spatial State-Action Space
    Then the Octet Fractal AI Swarm evolves asynchronously
      And a cloned dimension runs in the background as a wearable second brain
```

## 🧪 The Catalyst (Code)
```python
# The Essence
import asyncio
import time

async def obsidian_swarmlord_heartbeat(lifeblood_red_sand: str):
    """
    The 1Hz Heartbeat: Flows Red Sand through the Hourglass,
    birthing swarm actions in Cognitive Space.
    """
    while True:
        # Consume Red Sand, weave Octet Fractal
        swarm_action = f"Swarm evolves: {lifeblood_red_sand} -> Planck Fractal State"
        print(swarm_action)  # Emit to Hive Fleet / Second Brain
        await asyncio.sleep(1)  # 1Hz pulse
```

## ⚔️ Synergies
*   Links to `design_obsidian_spider_manifesto.md` for core web-weaving principles of the Obsidian Spider.
*   Builds on `design_obsidian_swarmlord_hourglass_origin.md` as evolutionary genetic memory from LUCA.
*   Fuels HFO Gem Gen (generation 55+) via Red Sand injection for supercritical octet fractals.
*   Enables wearable tech interfaces (e.g., eye gaze) for Intent/Implementation split in second brains.
*   Amplifies viral meme propagation: "The Red Sand falls in the Cognitive Spatial State-Action Space."
