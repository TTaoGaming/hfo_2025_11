# 🃏 Verse 0, Line 4: The Injection

> **Intuition**: Time as Chronos injects the vital pulse, transforming static logic into rhythmic, iterative life within the fractal swarm.

## 📜 The Incantation (Intent)
```gherkin
Feature: Injector Chronos Activation

  Scenario: Inject rhythmic pulse into the branched logic and spawned agents
    Given the Fractal Seed "One Fractal Seed to rule the Eight"
    And Eight-Fold Logic "Branch Eight-Fold Logic from the Gate"
    And Agents spawned "Spawn Agents for the Future State"
    When the Injector pulses at variable rates
    Then the system iterates with heartbeat rhythm
    And feedback loops ignite emergent computation
```

## 🧪 The Catalyst (Code)
```python
# The Essence: Inject pulses at configurable rates to drive iteration
import time
import itertools

def inject_pulse(rate: float = 1.0):
    """
    Chronos Injector: Yields rhythmic pulses to animate the swarm.
    rate: pulses per second (variable frequency).
    """
    pulse_gen = itertools.count()
    while True:
        yield f"Pulse #{next(pulse_gen)} at rate {rate}"
        time.sleep(1 / rate)
```

## ⚔️ Synergies
*   **Links to OBSIDIAN Pillars**: Position 4 (I-Injector) after O (Observer), B (Bridger), S (Shaper); precedes D (Disruptor), I (Immunizer), A (Assimilator), N (Navigator).
*   **Verse 0 Predecessors**: Pulses Line 1's Fractal Seed, flows through Line 2's Eight-Fold Logic, drives Line 3's Agent spawning into cycles.
*   **Stigmergy Engine**: Provides timing backbone for agent feedback loops, enabling frequency-modulated emergence.
*   **Holon Integration**: Activates in generation 61 workshops; extensible to scheduler for multi-rate injection across swarm nodes.
