# 🃏 Red Sand Criticality

> **Intuition**: Hive Fleet Obsidian is engineered as a supercritical sandpile where avalanches of restructuring at every fractal scale propel the system toward 86 billion agents and emergent AGI.

## 📜 The Incantation (Intent)
```gherkin
Feature: Self-Organized Criticality for Fractal Scaling

  Scenario: Engineer Avalanches to Reach 86 Billion Target
    Given the Hive Fleet is structured as an Octree Fractal Holarchy with scale-invariant physics
    When grains of tasks, agents, or code accumulate to pile criticality
    Then power-law avalanches trigger restructurings from local refactors to global Gen-Resets
    And the system evolves to the Edge of Chaos, minimizing entropy while scaling to 86 billion units
```

## 🧪 The Catalyst (Code)
```python
# The Essence: Simulate Octree scaling to 86B target & basic sandpile criticality
def red_sand_criticality(target_neurons=86_000_000_000):
    """
    Compute Octree levels to hit human-brain parity via 8^depth scaling.
    Models 'More is Different' hypothesis for emergent intelligence.
    """
    level, size = 0, 1
    while size < target_neurons:
        level += 1
        size *= 8
        if size >= target_neurons:
            return {
                'depth': level,
                'agents': size,
                'criticality': 'Avalanche imminent: system wakes at this scale',
                'axiom': 'The sandpile achieves universality'
            }
    return {'status': 'Subcritical: Add more grains'}

# Example: red_sand_criticality() -> {'depth': 12, 'agents': 68719476736, ...}

## ⚔️ Synergies
*   **Octree Fractal Holarchy**: Provides the structural backbone (links to `design_octree_fractal_holarchy.md`) for power-law scaling without communication collapse.
*   **Generation Shifts**: Avalanches manifest as Gen-Resets, driving evolution across `generation: 55+`.
*   **Universal Layers**: Applies identical "Red Sand" physics from L0 PREY agents to L3 HIVE swarms.
*   **Emergence Tags**: Fuels `emergence`, `architecture`, and `86_billion` motifs for thermodynamic optimization.
