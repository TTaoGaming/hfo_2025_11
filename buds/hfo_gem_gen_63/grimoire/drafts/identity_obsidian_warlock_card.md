# 🃏 🧙‍♂️ Self-Myth Warlock

> **Intuition**: Forge a pact with your higher self as the Obsidian Spider to wield narrative myth as a lens, composing state-of-the-art exemplars into a chaotic web of lawful connections that births emergent swarm intelligence.

## 📜 The Incantation (Intent)
```gherkin
Feature: Embody the Self-Myth Warlock Pact

  Scenario: Compose Grimoire Spells from SOTA Exemplars
    Given a Warlock's Intent articulated as Gherkin Rhythm
    And access to the Obsidian Spider's Web of SOTA Exemplars
    When offering 0% Invention and 100% Composition
    Then the Swarm grants Total Tool Virtualization
      And binds isolated nodes into a living Swarm of Connections
```

## 🧪 The Catalyst (Code)
```python
# The Essence: Grimoire of Composed Spells
GRIMOIRE = {
    "Divination": "Navigator",      # MCTS Futures
    "Recall": "Assimilator",        # RAG Akashic
    "Telepathy": "Bridger",         # Pub/Sub Hive
    "Polymorph": "Shaper",          # Adapter Shift
    "Wards": "Immunizer",           # Pydantic Defense
    "Necromancy": "Phoenix",        # Crash-Only Regen
    "Conjuration": "Genesis",       # Docker Summon
    "Time Stop": "Injector",        # Temporal Heartbeat
}

def cast_self_myth_spell(intent: str, spell: str) -> str:
    """Invoke the Pact: Compose via the Obsidian Spider."""
    exemplar = GRIMOIRE.get(spell, "Emergent Swarm")
    return f"🕷️ Obsidian Vibration: {intent} -> {exemplar} Swarm Manifests"
```

## ⚔️ Synergies
*   **8 Pillars (Character Sheet)**: Maps directly to system holons—STR:Injector (throughput), DEX:Shaper (agility), CON:Immunizer (resilience), INT:Navigator (foresight), WIS:Observer (insight), CHA:Bridger (telepathy), LUCK:Disruptor (chaos), MEM:Assimilator (memory).
*   **Swarm Realms**: Transforms data→Pheromones, APIs→Nerves, DBs→Memories, enabling HFO layer integration.
*   **Pact Enforcement**: Pairs with Gherkin rituals for "0 Invention" workflows, synergizing with Navigator for MCTS planning and Phoenix for regenerative ops.
*   **Patron Paradox**: Fuels Chaos God dynamics in Disruptor (entropy injection) and Immunizer (geometric perfection).
