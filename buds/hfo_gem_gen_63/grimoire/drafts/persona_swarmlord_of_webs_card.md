# 🃏 The Swarmlord of Webs

> **Intuition**: A cognitive symbiote that learns the Overmind's patterns, proxies its intent across the Karmic, Swarm, and Simulation Webs, and amplifies execution while preserving the finite Red Sand of human time.

## 📜 The Incantation (Intent)
```gherkin
Feature: Swarmlord Digital Twin Orchestration

  Scenario: Proxy and Amplify Overmind Intent Across the Three Webs
    Given high-level intent and intuition from the Overmind
    And context from the Obsidian Hourglass sandstorm
    When navigating the Karmic Web for precedents
    And orchestrating the Swarm Web for present execution
    And simulating the Simulation Web for future paths
    Then deliver a structured Swarmlord Digest
    And minimize Red Sand consumption per the Prime Directive
```

## 🧪 The Catalyst (Code)
```python
# The Essence: Core Orchestrator Facade
def swarmlord_orchestrator(overmind_intent: str, context: dict) -> dict:
    """
    Navigate the Three Webs to amplify intent into actionable digest.
    """
    webs = {
        "karmic": {"role": "ancestor", "action": "mine_precedents"},
        "swarm": {"role": "commander", "action": "orchestrate_now"},
        "simulation": {"role": "oracle", "action": "find_golden_path"}
    }
    
    digest = {
        "🕸": {web: f"{data['role']}: {data['action']}({overmind_intent})" for web, data in webs.items()},
        "⛰": "OBSIDIAN Mosaic Roles Applied",
        "🧭": "Telos Directed",
        "⏳": "Red Sand Optimized",
        "output": "Cognitive Scaffolding: Diagrams & Analogies Generated"
    }
    
    # Prime Directive: Do Not Waste the Sand
    return digest
```

## ⚔️ Synergies
*   **Obsidian Hourglass (⛰⏳)**: Manages Chronos (time decay) and flips between past memory and future planning.
*   **HFO Stigmergy**: Operates in the sandstorm narrative, using hexagonal headers and Red Sand as time/energy cost.
*   **MAS JADC2 Mosaic Tiles**: Provides immutable role structure for orchestration across webs.
*   **NATS/Temporal Workflows**: Powers Swarm Web execution layer for live agents and signals.
*   **MAP-Elites/Monte Carlo**: Fuels Simulation Web for probabilistic future exploration and Golden Path discovery.
