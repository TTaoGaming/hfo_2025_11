# 📖 The Obsidian Grimoire (Deck of Code)

> **Intuition**: You are the Warlock. This is your **Deck**.
> Each file here is a **Card** (a reusable pattern of Intent + Code).
> When you want to build something, you don't "write code from scratch"; you **Cast a Spell** (Play a Card) and let the Swarm resolve the effect.

## 🃏 Card Anatomy

Every Card in this Grimoire follows this structure:

1.  **The Mana Cost (Inputs)**: What you need to provide (e.g., a `.feature` file, a config).
2.  **The Incantation (Intent)**: The Declarative Gherkin (`Given/When/Then`) that defines the rules.
3.  **The Effect (Implementation)**: The Python/YAML code that makes it real.
4.  **The Flavor (Intuition)**: Why this card exists.

## 📚 The Deck List

### 🔥 Sorceries (Protocols & Actions)
*   [**Spell 01: The Phoenix Genesis**](spell_01_phoenix_genesis.md)
    *   *Effect*: Burns a drifted component and regenerates it from pure Intent.
    *   *Use Case*: "This code is messy. Fix it."

### 🏰 Enchantments (Stigmergy & Rules)
*   *(Coming Soon)* **The Iron Ledger**: Immutable logging.
*   *(Coming Soon)* **The Hexagonal Field**: Standardized Holon headers.

### 🤖 Artifact Creatures (Agents & Tools)
*   *(Coming Soon)* **The Bridger**: A connection agent.
*   *(Coming Soon)* **The Heartbeat**: The system pulse.

## 🎮 How to Play a Card

1.  **Select the Card**: Find the pattern you need in this folder.
2.  **Pay the Cost**: Create the required input file (e.g., `my_feature.feature`).
3.  **Cast the Spell**: Run the associated script or command.
4.  **Resolve**: The Swarm generates the code.
