# 🐍 HFO Gen 63: The Hydra Platform

> **Status**: Active Construction
> **Goal**: Clean. Consolidate. Test.
> **Predecessor**: Gen 61 (The Bud)
> **Successor**: Gen 64 (The Ascension)

## 📌 Overview
Generation 63 is the **Cleanroom**. We are taking the scattered successful proofs-of-concept (POCs) from previous generations (OpenRouter, Swarm, NATS, Ray) and forging them into a single, unified, self-cleaning platform: **The Hydra**.

## 📂 Structure
*   `brain/`: Intent, Documentation, and Manifestos.
*   `src/`: The consolidated source code (Python).
*   `memory/`: The persistent storage (Cold Stigmergy).
*   `AGENTS.md`: The coordination hub for AI Agents.
