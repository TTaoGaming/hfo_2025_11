  "query": "What is the recommended file structure for the Organ Registry or Fractal Octree in HFO? How should the 8 pillars be mapped to directories?",
  "result": "For the Hydrogen Fleet Obsidian (HFO) Gen 63, the file structure of the Organ Registry is designed to map the 8 Metaphysical Pillars of the Fractal Octree to specific physical directories, each representing an \"Organ.\" Here's how the 8 pillars are mapped to these directories:\n\n1. **Navigator (Telos - Purpose)**\n   - **Directory**: `brain/`\n   - **Functions**: \n     - `intent_declarative_gherkin` (files using the .feature extension for behavior definitions using Given/When/Then syntax)\n     - `visuals_swarmlord_digest` (markdown files for summaries and strategic overviews)\n\n2. **Observer (Ontos - Reality)**\n   - **Directory**: `eyes/`\n   - **Functions**:\n     - `sensor_active_monitor` (Python scripts for polling external APIs/state)\n     - `feed_passive_stream` (listeners for RSS/Webhook)\n\n3. **Bridger (Logos - Connection)**\n   - **Directory**: `memory/`\n   - **Functions**:\n     - `library_diataxis` (structured knowledge like tutorials, guides, references, explanations)\n     - `store_vector_lance` (raw LanceDB artifacts)\n\n4. **Shaper (Techne - Craft)**\n   - **Directory**: `forge/`\n   - **Functions**:\n     - `tool_mcp_server` (Model Context Protocol servers)\n     - `script_python_automation` (standalone executable scripts)\n\n5. **Injector (Chronos - Time)**\n   - **Directory**: `pulse/`\n   - **Functions**:\n     - `heartbeat_async_cycle` (logic for the 1-1-8-1 loop)\n     - `schedule_cron_trigger` (temporal schedules)\n\n6. **Disruptor (Pathos - Emotion/Test)**\n   - **Directory**: `venom/`\n   - **Functions**:\n     - `test_chaos_monkey` (scripts that intentionally break things)\n     - `audit_drift_detector` (checking for divergence from intent)\n\n7. **Immunizer (Ethos - Ethics/Guard)**\n   - **Directory**: `carapace/`\n   - **Functions**:\n     - `guard_pydantic_validator` (data schemas and type checks)\n     - `policy_access_control` (security rules)\n\n8. **Assimilator (Topos - Place/Context)**\n   - **Directory**: `digest/`\n   - **Functions**:\n     - `ingest_delta_parser` (scripts converting raw data to vectors)\n     - `graph_context_mapper` (builders for NetworkX/Neo4j graphs)\n\nThe registry file `REGISTRY.yaml`, located at the root of `buds/hfo_gem_gen_63/`, dynamically maps these associations, ensuring that each file is placed within the appropriate organ based on its function. This system promotes discoverability, standardization, and alignment with the cognitive architecture, ensuring that the file system reflects the operational hierarchy of the HFO architecture.",
