# 🧹 HFO Gen 63: The Great Consolidation

> **Mission**: Clean up. Consolidate. Test. Prepare for the Ascension (Gen 64).
> **Motto**: "Less is More. Stronger is Better."

## 1. The Mandate
Generation 63 is not about expansion; it is about **contraction and densification**.
We have sprawled across generations (51-61). We have tools scattered (OpenRouter, Swarm POC, NATS, Ray, Temporal).
Now, we forge them into a single, cohesive **Hydra Platform**.

## 2. The Objectives
1.  **Consolidate the Stack**:
    *   Unify the "Intent Layer" (Gherkin/Mermaid).
    *   Unify the "Logic Layer" (Instructor/LangGraph).
    *   Unify the "Compute Layer" (Ray).
    *   Unify the "Memory Layer" (NATS/LanceDB).
2.  **Purify the Code**: Remove dead code, deprecated buds, and "ghost" holons.
3.  **Test Everything**: Rigorous testing of the core loop (Perceive -> Orchestrate -> Act).
4.  **Small Scale Vision**: Create a minimal, functional version of the Obsidian Spider that *works* end-to-end.

## 3. The Tech Stack (Refined)
*   **LLM Gateway**: OpenRouter (Access to SOTA models).
*   **Agent Framework**: OpenAI Swarm (POC) / LangGraph.
*   **Orchestration**: Temporal (Durable Execution).
*   **Memory**: LanceDB (Vector) + NATS (Stream).

## 4. The Path to Gen 64
Gen 64 is the "Big Push". Gen 63 is the base camp.
We do not climb the mountain until our gear is checked and our packs are light.

> *The Spider tightens its web before the storm.*
