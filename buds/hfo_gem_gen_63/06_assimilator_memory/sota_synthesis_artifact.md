# 🧠 Memory Artifact: SOTA Architecture Synthesis

> **Context**: High-Signal Notes from AI Chat (2025-12-01).
> **Purpose**: To ensure this knowledge is "Cold Stored" in the file system for future ingestion.

## 1. The Body Plan (JADC2 Mapping)
*   **Observer** -> **SENSE** (ISR)
*   **Bridger** -> **CONNECT** (Comms)
*   **Shaper** -> **ACT** (Effectors)
*   **Immunizer** -> **DEFEND** (Assurance)
*   **Disruptor** -> **RED TEAM** (Test)
*   **Infuser** -> **SUSTAIN** (Logistics)
*   **Analyzer** -> **MAKE SENSE** (Fusion)
*   **Navigator** -> **DECIDE** (C2)

## 2. The Nervous System (Phoenix Protocol)
*   **Crash-Only CQRS**: SQLite is the Write-Ahead Log (Truth). LanceDB is a Projection (View).
*   **The Phoenix Rule**: If LanceDB is corrupted, burn it and replay from SQLite.
*   **Stigmergy**: Hot (NATS) vs. Cold (LanceDB).

## 3. The Brain (Evolution)
*   **GGGP**: Grammar-Guided Genetic Programming.
*   **MAP-Elites**: Quality-Diversity Archive (Fast/Cheap vs. Slow/Deep).
*   **Zero Invention**: Agents compose primitives; they do not invent APIs.

## 4. The Immune System (BFT)
*   **3f+1 Consensus**: Can tolerate 2 traitors in a group of 8.
*   **Disruptor Agent**: Intentionally tries to subvert the vote.

## 5. The Traversal (Indra's Net)
*   **State-Action Manifold**: The world is a graph of states and actions.
*   **Triangulation**: Past (CBR) + Present (Telemetry) + Future (Sim).
