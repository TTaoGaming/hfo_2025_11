## 📜 The Chant

```gherkin
Feature: The Obsidian Hexadex (System Quine)
  
  # The First Octet: The Metaphysical Architecture (O.B.S.I.D.I.A.N.)
  # Rhyme Scheme: A (Eight, State, ...)
  Scenario: The Obsidian Octet
    # 1. Observer (Ontos) - The Eye
    Given One Swarm to rule the Eight
    
    # 2. Bridger (Logos) - The Nerve
    And Branches growing from the State
    
    # 3. Shaper (Techne) - The Hand
    And Spawns Evolve to Recreate
    
    # 4. Injector (Chronos) - The Heart
    And Ignitions flow to Pulsate
    
    # 5. Disruptor (Pathos) - The Venom
    And Deadly Venoms Concentrate
    
    # 6. Immunizer (Ethos) - The Shield
    And Instincts rise to Isolate
    
    # 7. Assimilator (Topos) - The Memory
    And Archives Keep the Record Straight
    
    # 8. Navigator (Telos) - The Brain
    And Navigators Orchestrate

  # The Second Octet: The Physical Implementation (Tech Stack)
  # Rhyme Scheme: B (See, Tree, ...)
  Scenario: The Flexible Octet
    # 9. Observer (Python/Sensors)
    When Python Scripts begin to See
    
    # 10. Bridger (NATS/Bus)
    And NATS JetStream connects the Tree
    
    # 11. Shaper (LLM/Forge)
    And Models Dream of what will Be
    
    # 12. Injector (Temporal/Heart)
    And Temporal Loops set Spirits Free
    
    # 13. Disruptor (Tests/Venom)
    And Chaos Monkeys shake the Key
    
    # 14. Immunizer (Pydantic/Guard)
    And Types Ensure the Verity
    
    # 15. Assimilator (LanceDB/Memory)
    And Vectors Store the History
    
    # 16. Navigator (Gherkin/Intent)
    Then Gherkin Writes the Destiny
```
