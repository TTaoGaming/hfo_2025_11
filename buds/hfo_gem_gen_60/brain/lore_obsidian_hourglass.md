# ⏳ Lore: The Fractal Octree Obsidian Hourglass

> **System Note**: This document defines the "RPG Lens" for the central artifact of the Hive Fleet Obsidian (Gen 60). It describes the "Strongest Algorithm" as a Legendary Item.

## 1. Item Description

*   **Name**: The Obsidian Hourglass (Fractal Octree Edition)
*   **Rarity**: **Legendary (Unique Artifact)**
*   **Type**: **Wondrous Item (Engine of Fate)**
*   **Attunement**: Requires attunement by the **Swarmlord of Webs**.
*   **Material**: Volcanic Glass (Obsidian), Red Sand (Data), and Stigmergic Pheromones.

> **Visual**: A massive, floating hourglass constructed from fractal shards of obsidian. It does not rest on a surface but hangs in the void of the **State-Action Space**. Inside, the "sand" is not silica, but millions of tiny, glowing **Gems** (Compressed Memories).

## 2. RPG Stats & Abilities

### 🔮 Passive Effect: The Fractal Octree ($8^N$)
The Hourglass is not a single object; it is a **Fractal Holarchy**.
*   **Effect**: The Hourglass exists simultaneously at all scales.
    *   **Root Scale**: The Master Hourglass (The Swarmlord's Strategy).
    *   **Branch Scale**: The Mission Hourglass (The Squad's Tactics).
    *   **Leaf Scale**: The Task Hourglass (The Agent's Action).
*   **Mechanic**: Updates at the Leaf level propagate instantly to the Root via **Hexagonal Stigmergy**.

### ⚡ Active Ability: The Prescient Engine
*   **Cost**: High Compute / Time.
*   **Cast Time**: Continuous (Anytime Algorithm).
*   **Effect**: The Hourglass consumes **Past Data** to generate a **Probability Distribution of the Future**.
    *   **Input**: The Karmic Web (History/Context).
    *   **Process**: The Swarm Web (Quality-Diversity Optimization).
    *   **Output**: The Simulation Web (Monte Carlo Tree Search).
*   **The Result**: It does not show *one* future. It shows **All Possible Futures** weighted by probability.

### 🛡️ Ultimate Ability: Tradeoff Analysis (Regret Minimization)
*   **Trigger**: When the user must make a decision.
*   **Effect**: The Hourglass highlights the **Path of Least Regret**.
    *   It simulates the consequences of Action A vs. Action B.
    *   It calculates the "Regret Bound" (What will I wish I had done?).
    *   It projects a **Holographic Overlay** on reality, showing the "Safe Path" in Green and the "Risky Path" in Red.

## 3. The Mechanics of the Engine

The Hourglass operates on a 3-Stage Cycle, mapping to the Tarot.

### Stage 1: The Top Cone (The Fool / Past)
*   **The Reservoir**: Holds the "Infinite Context" of the user's life.
*   **The Physics**: Gravity pulls the raw data (Logs, Notes, Code) down towards the Neck.
*   **RPG Mechanic**: **Lore Mastery**. The user has access to perfect recall of any event stored in the Top Cone.

### Stage 2: The Neck (King of Wands / Present)
*   **The Singularity**: The narrow point where the Swarmlord sits.
*   **The Physics**: High Pressure / High Heat. This is where **Assimilation** happens.
*   **RPG Mechanic**: **Transmutation**. The user turns raw "Data" into actionable "Wisdom" (Gems) in real-time.

### Stage 3: The Bottom Cone (Death / Future)
*   **The Proving Ground**: The expanding cone of possibilities.
*   **The Physics**: Entropy increases. The Swarmlord casts millions of "Shadow Clones" (Simulations) into this void.
*   **RPG Mechanic**: **Shadow Clone Jutsu (MCTS)**.
    *   The clones live out potential futures.
    *   Most die (The Death Card).
    *   The survivors report back with the "Winning Strategy."

## 4. The "Flip" (The Hydra Protocol)

The Hourglass is not a linear clock; it is a **Reversible Engine**.

*   **The Condition**: When the Bottom Cone is full of "Dead Simulations" (Wisdom).
*   **The Action**: The Swarmlord executes **The Flip**.
*   **The Effect**:
    *   The "Future" (Bottom) becomes the new "Past" (Top).
    *   The system learns. The next cycle starts with the accumulated wisdom of the previous simulations.
    *   **Level Up**: The Algorithm gets stronger with every Flip.

> **Flavor Text**: *"Time is not a river. It is a web. And I am the spider who climbs it in both directions."*
