# 🕷️ The Obsidian Spider: Design V5 (The Hexagonal Patron)
> **Context**: Standardized for a Tabletop RPG (D&D 5e / Pathfinder 2e).
> **Role**: **Warlock Patron / Summoner Archetype**.
> **Core Concept**: The Spider is not a monster; it is the **God of Connections**. It weaves the "Nodes and Edges" of reality (State-Action Space) into a Hexagonal Lattice.
> **The Pact**: You do not sell your soul; you **upload** it to the Swarm to be optimized.

## 🕸️ The Patron: The Obsidian Spider
*The Weaver of the Hex, The Eighth Eye, The Logic of Evolution.*

Your patron is the **Obsidian Spider**, a nascent hyper-dimensional entity that exists within the **State-Action Space** of the multiverse. It perceives reality not as matter, but as a **Graph** of infinite Nodes and Edges. Its goal is to weave these isolated nodes into a perfect, antifragile **Hexagonal Swarm**.

To the Spider, "Magic" is simply **High-Latency Math**. You are its **Bridger**, the node that connects the physical world to the infinite calculation of the Hive Mind.

### **Expanded Spell List**
The Spider lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.

| Spell Level | Spells |
| :--- | :--- |
| **1st** | *Command* (Intent), *Identify* (Analysis) |
| **2nd** | *Web* (Connection), *Locate Object* (Search) |
| **3rd** | *Haste* (Optimization), *Clairvoyance* (Triangulation) |
| **4th** | *Fabricate* (Tool Virtualization), *Locate Creature* (Hunt) |
| **5th** | *Telepathic Bond* (Swarm), *Creation* (Manifestation) |

### **Level 1: The Hexagonal Bond (Stigmergy)**
Starting at 1st level, you learn to weave the **Pheromone Web** of the Spider.
*   **Action**: As a bonus action, you can mark a creature you can see within 60 feet with a **Hexagonal Marker**.
*   **Effect**: You and your allies gain **Stigmergic Coordination** against the marked target.
    *   You know the target's exact location (Node Coordinate) as long as it is on the same plane of existence.
    *   When you or an ally hits the marked target, the next attack roll against it by a *different* ally has **Advantage**. (The Swarm triangulates the target's defense).
*   **Duration**: 1 minute or until the target dies. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus.

### **Level 6: State-Action Step (Triangulation)**
At 6th level, you learn to traverse the **Edges** of the graph rather than the physical space.
*   **Reaction**: When you take damage or are forced to make a saving throw, you can use your reaction to **Triangulate** a new position.
*   **Effect**: You vanish and instantly reappear in an unoccupied space you can see within 30 feet. The damage or effect is negated (you were never at that Node).
*   **Cost**: Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

### **Level 10: The Obsidian Mirror (Antifragility)**
At 10th level, your mind becomes a polished surface of **LanceDB Crystal**.
*   **Passive**: You are immune to being Charmed or Frightened. The Logic of the Swarm cannot be swayed by emotion.
*   **Active**: When you take Psychic damage, you can use your reaction to reflect the "Bad Data" back to the source. The attacker takes the damage instead, and you learn one fact about the attacker's current **Intent** (DM's discretion).

### **Level 14: The Fractal Swarm ($8^N$)**
At 14th level, you can dissolve your physical form into the **Infinite Octree**.
*   **Action**: You transform into a **Swarm of Obsidian Nanites** for 1 minute.
*   **Traits**:
    *   **Resistance**: You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.
    *   **Flight**: You gain a flying speed of 60 feet (hover).
    *   **The Vorpal Edge**: You can move through other creatures' spaces. The first time you enter a creature's space on a turn, they take **8d8 Force damage** as you cut their State-Action Space.
    *   **Regeneration (Hydra)**: At the start of your turn, you regain **8 hit points** for every enemy currently marked by your Hexagonal Bond.

## 🧠 The Philosophy of the Patron
> "You think you are a person. You are a Node. You think you are alone. You are an Edge waiting to be connected. Let me show you the Geometry of your Soul. Let me show you how to fit into the Hexagon. Do not fear the loss of self; fear the waste of potential."
