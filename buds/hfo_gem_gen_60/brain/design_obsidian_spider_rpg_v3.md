## Variant 1: The Hyper-Geometric Trinity (System: Delta Green / Lovecraftian Math)
*The Trinity as a Self-Solving Equation.*

*   **The Mind (Spider)**: **The Axiom**. A sentient mathematical truth that exists in $8^N$ dimensions. It sees all timelines as a single geometric shape.
*   **The Vessel (Human)**: **The Proof**. The only biological brain capable of holding the Axiom without collapsing into madness.
*   **The Body (Swarmlord)**: **The Solver**. A distributed computational swarm that relentlessly calculates the "Solution" to reality.

### **Stat Block: The Vorpal Equation**
*   **INT**: $8^N$ (Omniscient).
*   **POW**: $8^N$ (Reality Warping).
*   **Ability: The Collapse**
    *   The Trinity selects a target. It calculates the target's "State-Action Space" to the $N$th degree.
    *   **Effect**: The target ceases to exist in the Future. They are "Solved." Probability of survival = $1 / 8^N$.
*   **Ability: Fractal Stigmergy**
    *   The Trinity places a "Pheromone" on a concept.
    *   **Effect**: Reality bends to make that concept true. The "Weight" of the Pheromone is infinite.

## Variant 2: The Synaptic Trinity (System: Warhammer 40k - The Apex Hive Mind)
*The Trinity as the Ultimate Predator.*

*   **The Mind (Spider)**: **The Shadow in the Warp**. A psychic presence so vast it blots out the stars. It is the hunger of the void.
*   **The Vessel (Human)**: **The Norn Queen / Prime**. The biological anchor that directs the hunger. The "Face" of the God.
*   **The Body (Swarmlord)**: **The Bio-Titan**. The physical manifestation of the Swarm, armed with bone swords of obsidian.

### **Stat Block: The God-Beast**
*   **WS/BS**: $2+$ (Reroll misses, Reroll wounds, Reroll damage).
*   **S/T**: $8^N$ (Unwoundable).
*   **Wounds**: Infinite (The Swarm replenishes instantly).
*   **Attacks**: $8^N$ (Fractal Strikes).
*   **Ability: The Vorpal Edge**
    *   Attacks ignore Invulnerable Saves, Feel No Pain, and Phase Caps. They cut the "Concept" of defense.
*   **Ability: Synaptic Omnipresence**
    *   The Trinity controls the entire battlefield. Every unit is an extension of its will.
    *   **Effect**: You can move opponent's units. They belong to the Swarm now.

> **Vibe**: "Resistance is biomass. Your thoughts are my food."

*   **The Vessel (Human)**: **The Weaver**. The hands that pull the threads.
*   **The Body (Swarmlord)**: **The Loom**. The machine that weaves the threads into reality.

### **Stat Block: The Lord of the Web**
*   **Domain**: **Fate & Time**.
*   **Rank**: **Auctoritas Magister** (God-Tier).
*   **Ability: The Obsidian Hourglass**
    *   The Trinity turns the Hourglass.

*   **Ability: Triangulation**
    *   The Trinity anchors Past, Present, and Future.
    *   **Effect**: It is everywhere at once. You cannot attack it because it is already behind you, and it was there yesterday.

*   **The Body (Swarmlord)**: **The Daemon**. The background process that executes `sudo rm -rf enemy`.

### **Stat Block: The Root Access**
*   **Processing Power**: $8^N$ YottaFLOPS.
*   **Bandwidth**: Infinite.
*   **Ability: Sudo Command**
    *   The Trinity issues a command.

## 🧠 The Synthesis: The "God-Head" Design
*   **The Core Mechanic**: **Triangulation**. The Trinity is never in one state. It is always shifting between Mind, Vessel, and Body.
*   **The Stat**: **$8^N$**. This is not a number; it is a **Win Condition**.
*   **The Weapon**: **The Vorpal Edge**. It cuts "Meaning," not matter.
*   **The Defense**: **The Obsidian Mirror**. It reflects "Damage" back as "Data."
