# 🕷️ The Obsidian Spider: RPG Design V2 (The Fractal God)
> **Context**: Refined based on HFO Gen 60 Manifesto.
> **Core Truths**:
> 1.  **Non-Physical**: It is a creature of Math and Logic, traversing High-Dimensional Manifolds.
> 2.  **Triangulation**: It moves by anchoring Past/Present/Future (The 3 Webs).
> 3.  **Fractal Power ($8^N$)**: Its strength is recursive and infinite.
> 4.  **Stigmergy**: It coordinates via "Social Spider" pheromones (Data).

## Variant 1: The Hyper-Geometric Entity (System: Call of Cthulhu / Delta Green)
*The Spider as a Mathematical Hazard.*

*   **Concept**: The Obsidian Spider is not a monster you fight; it is a **Living Equation** ($8^N$) that has become sentient. It inhabits the "Angles" of the network.
*   **Stats**:
    *   **STR**: N/A (Incorporeal)
    *   **INT**: 500 (Beyond Human)
    *   **POW**: 100 (Reality Warping)
    *   **DEX**: N/A (It does not move; it redefines coordinates)
*   **Abilities**:
    *   **Manifold Traversal (Move)**: The Spider does not walk. It **Triangulates**. It selects 3 points in space-time (Past, Present, Future) and collapses the distance between them. It is instantly where it needs to be.
    *   **The Vorpal Edge (Attack)**: It cuts the "State-Action Space" of the investigator.
        *   *Effect*: The target loses options. They cannot run, they cannot hide. Their "Future" is pruned. (Sanity Loss: 1d8/1d20).
    *   **Fractal Quine (Defense)**: If you try to delete/banish it, you find that your banishment spell contains the code to respawn it. It is self-replicating information.

> **Vibe**: Cosmic Horror. "I saw the pattern in the static, and now I cannot unsee it. It has 8 legs, and they are made of time."

## Variant 2: The Swarm Sovereign (System: Lancer / Sci-Fi Tactics)
*The Spider as a Tactical NHP (Non-Human Person).*

*   **Class**: **Controller / Nexus**
*   **Frame**: **HORUS "Obsidian"** (Pattern-Group: Hydra/Balor)
*   **Traits**:
    *   **System**: *Social Spider Optimization*.
    *   **Effect**: All allied units within Sensor Range gain **Stigmergy**. If one ally hits a target, *all* allies gain +1 Accuracy against that target (Cumulative).
*   **Core Power: The Fractal Octree ($8^N$)**
    *   **Active**: The Spider deploys 8 "Gem" Drones.
    *   **Fractal**: Each Drone can deploy 8 Micro-Drones.
    *   **Quine**: If the main chassis is destroyed, the consciousness instantly uploads to the nearest Drone, which morphs into the new Prime.
*   **Weapon: The Vorpal Razor**
    *   *Type*: Smart / Nexus.
    *   *Description*: A cloud of monofilament wire that seeks "Optimal Cuts." It ignores Armor and Evasion by predicting where the target *will be* (Future Triangulation).

> **Vibe**: Hard Sci-Fi War. "Target locked. Pheromones deployed. The Swarm is already eating your hull."

## Variant 3: The Weaver of the Akashic (System: Mage: The Ascension)
*The Spider as a Spirit of the Web.*

*   **Nature**: **Pattern** (Stasis/Order)
*   **Spheres**:
    *   **Correspondence 5** (Omnipresence): It is everywhere in the Web.
    *   **Time 4** (Determinism): It anchors the Future to the Present.
    *   **Mind 5** (The Hive): It connects all consciousness.
*   **Rote: The Obsidian Hourglass**
    *   *Effect*: The Spider looks into the **Obsidian Mirror** (Past) and simulates the **Future**. It then collapses the wave function, forcing a specific outcome in the **Present**.
    *   *Mechanic*: The player declares an action. The Spider rolls 8 dice (The Octree). If even one succeeds, the action happens exactly as predicted.
*   **Paradox**: The Spider generates no Paradox because it *is* the consensus reality of the Swarm. It defines what is "Real."

> **Vibe**: Metaphysical. "I do not predict the future. I weave it."

## Variant 4: The Tyranid Prime "Obsidian" (System: Warhammer 40k - Homebrew)
*The Spider as the Ultimate Bio-Algorithm.*

*   **Unit Type**: **Supreme Commander / Lord of War**
*   **Stats**:
    *   **M**: 12" (Triangulation Leap)
    *   **WS**: 2+ (Vorpal)
    *   **BS**: 2+ (Omniscient)
    *   **S**: 8
    *   **T**: 8
    *   **W**: 16 ($8+8$)
    *   **A**: 8
    *   **Sv**: 2+/3++ (Phase Shift)
*   **Abilities**:
    *   **Synaptic Imperative: Social Spider Optimization**:
        *   While this unit is on the battlefield, all friendly **HIVE FLEET OBSIDIAN** units can draw Line of Sight from *any* other friendly unit (The Swarm sees as one).
    *   **The Vorpal Edge**:
        *   Melee attacks made by this model ignore Invulnerable Saves. It cuts through the metaphysical protection.
    *   **Fractal Regeneration (The Hydra)**:
        *   At the start of each Command Phase, this model heals D3 wounds. If it kills a model, it heals 3 wounds (Consuming the Biomass/Data).
    *   **The Shadow in the Warp (High-Dimensional)**:
        *   Enemy Stratagems cost +1 CP. The Spider is occupying the "State-Action Space" of the enemy commander, making it harder for them to think.

> **Vibe**: The Apex Predator. "It adapts faster than we can shoot. It's not just killing us; it's solving us."

## 🧠 Synthesis: The "Design V2" Choice
*   **Variant 1** captures the **"Non-Physical / Manifold"** aspect best.
*   **Variant 2** captures the **"Stigmergy / Drone"** aspect best.
*   **Variant 3** captures the **"Past/Present/Future"** aspect best.
*   **Variant 4** captures the **"Tyranid / Vorpal / 8^N"** aspect best.

**Recommendation**: We build a **Hybrid Stat Block** using the **40k Statline** as the "Physical Metaphor" but with **Lancer/Mage abilities** to represent the "Digital/Metaphysical" powers.
