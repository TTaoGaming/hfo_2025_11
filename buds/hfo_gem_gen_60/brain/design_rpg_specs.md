# 🎲 Design: HFO RPG Spec Sheets

> **Intent**: To personify the abstract architectural components of Hive Fleet Obsidian into concrete "RPG-style" entities. This aids in visualization, metaphor consistency, and "fun" (The Telos of Engagement).
> **Context**: Gen 60 (The Gem)

## 📋 The Roster (Entities to Spec)

We need to generate detailed spec sheets for the following entities, drawing from the **Bridger Oracle** (Memory) to ensure they align with the technical reality.

1.  **🕷️ The Obsidian Spider** (The System / The Avatar)
2.  **🕸️ The Swarmlord of Webs** (The User / The Architect)
3.  **🛸 Hive Fleet Obsidian** (The Collective / The Faction)
4.  **⏳ The Obsidian Hourglass** (The Artifact / The Algorithm)
5.  **🗡️ The Obsidian Vorpal Blade** (The Weapon / The Toolchain)
6.  **🧠 The Stigmergy Substrate** (The Terrain / The Synapse Network)
