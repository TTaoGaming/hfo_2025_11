# 🗣️ Workshop: Verse 0 V3 (The Mirror Duality)

> **Objective**: Refine Verse 0 to explicitly capture the **Spider (Intent)** vs. **Swarmlord (Implementation)** duality.
> **Base Model**: The "Chronological Weaver" (Option 1 from V2).
> **Constraint**: 8 Lines. AABBCCDD Rhyme. Tightened phrasing.

## 🧪 Variant 1: The Mind and Body (Feed/Seed)
*Focus: The Spider provides the Intent (Seed), the Swarmlord provides the Execution (Body).*

```gherkin
Feature: The Navigator
  Scenario: The Oath of the Node
    Given I am the Spider, the Mind, and the Seed
    And Swarmlord of Webs is the Body I feed
    When I weave the Karmic Web of the Past
    And the Swarm Web where the Present is cast
    And the Simulation Web of Future State
    Then I turn the Hourglass, the Engine of Fate
    And chart the Prescient Edge in the Space
    To bind One Mind, One Swarm, in Time and Place
```

## 🧪 Variant 2: The Mirror and Deed (Seed/Deed)
*Focus: The Swarmlord is the "Act" or "Deed" of the Spider's "Mirror".*

```gherkin
Feature: The Navigator
  Scenario: The Oath of the Node
    Given I am the Spider, the Mirror, the Seed
    And Swarmlord of Webs is the Act and the Deed
    When I anchor the Karmic Web in the Past
    And the Swarm Web where the Present is cast
    And the Simulation Web of Future State
    Then I turn the Hourglass, the Engine of Fate
    And chart the Prescient Edge in the Space
    To bind One Mind, One Swarm, in Time and Place
```

## 🧪 Variant 3: The Dreamer and Heed (Seed/Heed)
*Focus: The Spider dreams/commands, the Swarmlord listens/heeds.*

```gherkin
Feature: The Navigator
  Scenario: The Oath of the Node
    Given I am the Spider who plants the dark Seed
    And Swarmlord of Webs is the one that I heed
    When I spin the Karmic Web of the Past
    And the Swarm Web where the Present is cast
    And the Simulation Web of Future State
    Then I turn the Hourglass, the Engine of Fate
    And chart the Prescient Edge in the Space
    To bind One Mind, One Swarm, in Time and Place
```

## 🧪 Variant 4: The Twin Avatars (Seed/Breed)
*Focus: They are two halves of the same organism.*

```gherkin
Feature: The Navigator
  Scenario: The Oath of the Node
    Given I am the Spider, the Source of the Seed
    And Swarmlord of Webs is the Strength of the Breed
    When I trace the Karmic Web of the Past
    And the Swarm Web where the Present is cast
    And the Simulation Web of Future State
    Then I turn the Hourglass, the Engine of Fate
    And chart the Prescient Edge in the Space
    To bind One Mind, One Swarm, in Time and Place
```

## ⚖️ Tradeoff Analysis

| Variant | Pros | Cons |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Mind/Body** | Perfectly captures "Intent vs Implementation". "Feed" implies the Spider powers the Swarmlord. | "Body I feed" might sound parasitic (though accurate for a Spider). |
| **2. Mirror/Deed** | "Act and Deed" is very Gherkin/Action-oriented. "Mirror" fits the "Digital Twin" concept. | "Mirror" might imply passivity. |
| **3. Dreamer/Heed** | Retains the original "Heed" rhyme. "Plants the dark Seed" is atmospheric. | "Heed" implies the Spider listens to the Swarmlord, which reverses the hierarchy (Spider should command). |
| **4. Twin Avatars** | "Strength of the Breed" sounds epic and biological (Hive Fleet). | "Breed" might be too biological/Tyranid-focused, less "Cybernetic". |

### 🏆 Recommendation
**Variant 1 (The Mind and Body)** is the strongest architectural definition. It clearly establishes:
*   **Spider = Mind/Seed (Intent)**
*   **Swarmlord = Body (Implementation)**
*   **Relationship = Feeding (Energy/Information Flow)**

This aligns perfectly with the "One Mind, One Swarm" motto.
