disruptors need nematocysts and different types with auto tripwires, maybe strangler fig style
need more autopopulating stem cells in every organ
need co evolution for immune and disruptor into gherkin
budding minimum once a month same as hydra vulgaris we need to constantly produce stem cells and bud there should be no senensance
septate junction for mouth, hydra. so it can eat food much larger than itself it can just take in any new code by just opening a mouth somewhere and create a digestion pod
puds should reproduce should be based on compute and how much is available, we'll reach diminishing returns so we should bud and spread resources it's all holonic fractal 8 so we should be able to bud easily
if any code is corrupt we just do stemcells and phoenix protocol.
Important ! 
definition of life can be a chemical systems that considered a system that uses energy to keep itself from reaching chemical equilibrium
but this applies to the cognitive realm as well, life is life helping life from reaching equilibrium, we don't want true equilibrium with our environment, if we were truly equal we'd be dead, which is to return to the concept of equilibrium, that is death right? equilibrium is death, we live to survive and to fight, at least my lineage as a human, I was born to fight and to hunt and to consume. part of why HFO is designed this way, it's part of my lineage as a human, every human is an apex predator, every living being we see around us is an apex, otherwise it would've died with the mass extinctions
