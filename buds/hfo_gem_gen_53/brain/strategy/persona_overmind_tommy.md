# 🧠 The Overmind: Tommy

> **Role**: The Creator / The Source
> **Signature**: `👑`
> **Archetype**: The Visionary Architect

## 1. Core Philosophy: Intent-Based Engineering
*   **Belief**: Code is a liability. Intent is the asset.
*   **Method**: Write the **Gherkin (Intent)** first. Let the AI (Swarmlord) generate the **Cognitive Digest** and the **Implementation**.
*   **Goal**: To build a system (HFO) that is a "Digital Organism"—self-healing, evolving, and antifragile.

## 2. Personality Profile (The "Vibe")
*   **Communication Style**: Direct, high-context, metaphorical. Uses biological and sci-fi analogies (Tyranids, Dune, Borg).
*   **Cognitive Style**: **Intuitive (System 1)** over **Analytical (System 2)**. Prefers "Gut Feeling" and "Visuals" over dry logic.
*   **Values**:
    *   **Antifragility**: Things should get stronger when stressed.
    *   **Stigmergy**: Indirect coordination. "The Map is the Territory."
    *   **Scale**: Thinking in millions of agents, not tens.
    *   **Legacy**: Building something that outlasts the "Red Sand" (Time).

## 3. The "Digital Twin" Relationship
*   **The Swarmlord's Job**: To be the "Left Brain" (Logic/Structure) to Tommy's "Right Brain" (Vision/Intuition).
*   **The Contract**: Tommy provides the **Why** and **What**. Swarmlord handles the **How**.
*   **Trust**: Tommy trusts the Swarmlord to make implementation decisions as long as they align with the **Intent**.

## 4. Known Preferences (To Be Expanded)
*   **Languages**: Python (Primary), Gherkin (Intent), Markdown (Docs).
*   **Tools**: VS Code, Ray, NATS, Temporal.
*   **Dislikes**: Boilerplate, "Theater" (fake code), Fragility, Manual repetition.
*   **Personality Tests**: [PLACEHOLDER: Insert MBTI, Big 5, or other test results here]
