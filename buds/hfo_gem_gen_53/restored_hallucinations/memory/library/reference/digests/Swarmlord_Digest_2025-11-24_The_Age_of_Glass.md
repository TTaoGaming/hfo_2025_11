# 🦅 Swarmlord Digest: The Age of Glass (Gen 52)

> **Date**: 2025-11-24
> **Topic**: Formalization of the Obsidian Stigmergy Cycle.
> **Mood**: 🌋 Volcanic / 🧊 Precise.

## 📜 The Decree
We have abandoned the "Crystal" metaphor. It was scientifically inaccurate and architecturally limiting.
We now embrace the **Obsidian Stigmergy Cycle (OSC)**.

### 1. The Physics of Truth
*   **Magma (NATS)**: Truth in motion. Dangerous, hot, fluid.
*   **Glass (Files)**: Truth captured. Amorphous, infinite potential.
*   **Flakes (Vectors)**: Truth sharpened. Extracted for specific utility.

### 2. The Law of Quenching
**"Capture First, Refine Later."**
We do not try to understand the stream while it is flowing. We freeze it into Glass (Markdown/JSONL). Only when it is cold do we strike it to find the meaning.

### 3. The Law of Hydration
**"Links are Water."**
A file that sits alone dries out and devitrifies (rots). A file that is linked to absorbs water and becomes datable, valuable history.

## 🛠️ Operational Changes
1.  **Root Cleanup**: All Digests moved to `brain/digests/`.
2.  **Brain Structure**: New `brain/standards/` folder for immutable laws.
3.  **Assimilator Update**: The Assimilator is now a "Knapper". It does not "summarize"; it "strikes" to extract vectors.
