Feature: Holonic File Governance
  As the Immunizer (Blue Team)
  I want to enforce strict file governance
  So that the Hive remains clean and navigable.

  Scenario: The Holocron (Registry)
    Given the file `brain/registry.yaml`
    Then it must define the "Biological Map" of the repo
    And every directory must map to an "Organ"
    And every file must belong to a registered Organ.

  Scenario: Swarmlord of Webs Format
    Given a Markdown summary file in `brain/`
    Then it must adhere to the "Swarmlord of Webs" format:
      | Section | Requirement |
      | Header | Stigmergic YAML Frontmatter |
      | BLUF | Bottom Line Up Front executive summary |
      | Matrix | A comparison or structural matrix table |
      | Visuals | At least 3 Mermaid diagrams (different views) |
      | Context | Executive Summary / 1-Pager text |
