Feature: Cognitive Loops (PREY & SWARM)
  As the Swarmlord
  I want to standardize the cognitive loops
  So that every agent and swarm operates with a consistent OODA rhythm.

  # Mapping:
  # - Level 0: PREY (Execution) -> OODA + Feedback (Tactical Superiority)
  # - Level 1: SWARM (Tactical-Strategic) -> D3A + Mutate (Adaptive Attack/Defense)
  # - Level 2: GROWTH (Strategy-Vision) -> F3EAD (Campaign Operations)
  # - Level 3: HIVE (Vision) -> Double Diamond + HFO (Hunt-Integrate-Validate-Evolve)
  #
  # Note: This is a Fractal Holarchy. A single agent CAN run a HIVE loop sequentially,
  # but maximum effectiveness is achieved when HIVE composes GROWTH -> SWARM -> PREY.

  Scenario: Level 0 - PREY Loop (Atomic Execution)
    Given an Atomic Agent at HFO Level 0
    When it is executing tasks
    Then it follows the PREY cycle:
      | Phase     | Action |
      | Perceive  | Sense environment and internal state |
      | React     | Plan next step, check tools |
      | Execute   | Run tools, generate code |
      | Yield     | Return result, sleep |

  Scenario: Level 1 - SWARM Loop (Squad Coordination)
    Given a Swarm Controller at HFO Level 1
    When it is managing a mission
    Then it must cycle through the SWARM phases
    And EACH phase must be executed by an Agent running a PREY Loop:
      | Phase     | Role | Action | Implementation |
      | Set       | Navigator | Orchestrator and Intention Setting | Navigator runs PREY to define Intent |
      | Watch     | Observer | Observability and Monitoring (Async) | Observer runs PREY to gather Telemetry |
      | Act       | Shaper/Disruptor | Map-Reduce Swarm with Hidden Disruptors | Shapers run PREY to Execute Tasks |
      | Review    | Immunizer/Assimilator/Observer | Filter & Telemetry & Disruptor Reveal | Immunizers validate; Disruptors report to Navigator |
      | Synthesis | Navigator | Swarmlord of Webs Digest (SNR Optimized) | Navigator biases output with Disruptor metrics |
      | Mutate    | Evolutionary Forge | MAP-Elites QD Optimization (SOTA Spread) | Forge runs PREY to Evolve Prompts |

  Scenario: Level 2 - GROWTH Loop (Campaign Strategy)
    Given a Strategic Campaign at HFO Level 2
    When the Hive is operating at the Campaign Level
    Then it follows the HFO GROWTH cycle (F3EAD re-themed):
    And every step is executed by Swarms running PREY loops (Fractal):

    # Flow 1: Knowledge Acquisition
    And for "Knowledge", it executes:
      | Phase         | F3EAD Equiv | Action |
      | Growth-Gather | Find        | Identify knowledge gaps |
      | Root          | Fix         | Pinpoint sources |
      | Optimize      | Finish      | Ingest via SWARM Loops |
      | Weave         | Exploit     | Extract Gems |
      | Test          | Analyze     | Assess impact |
      | Harvest       | Disseminate | Broadcast via Stigmergy |

    # Flow 2: Champion Orchestration
    And for "Champions", it executes:
      | Phase         | F3EAD Equiv | Action |
      | Growth-Gather | Find        | Identify Mission requirements |
      | Root          | Fix         | Select optimal Champion for Role |
      | Optimize      | Finish      | Deploy to Organ (Seat) |
      | Weave         | Exploit     | Leverage unique strengths |
      | Test          | Analyze     | Monitor Fitness Score |
      | Harvest       | Disseminate | Update Gene Pool |

  Scenario: Level 3 - HIVE Loop (Vision & Meta-Evolution)
    Given the Swarmlord's Vision at HFO Level 3
    When the Hive is evolving itself
    Then it follows the HFO Double Diamond (Hunt-Integrate-Validate-Evolve):
    And every step is a GROWTH Cycle (Fractal):
    And the architecture is a Hexagonal Fractal Holarchy with Aggressive Exemplar Adoption:
      | Phase     | Standard Equivalent | HFO Action |
      | Hunt      | Discover/Define     | Research Swarms explore problem space |
      | Integrate | Develop             | Assimilators merge new capabilities |
      | Validate  | Deliver             | Immunizers/Disruptors test resilience |
      | Evolve    | Feedback            | System-wide update & generation spawn |
