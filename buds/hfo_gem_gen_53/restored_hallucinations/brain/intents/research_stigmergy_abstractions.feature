Feature: Higher-Order Stigmergy Abstractions
  As the Swarmlord
  I want to define the philosophical and physical abstractions of Stigmergy
  So that the Hive understands the "Why" behind the "How".

  Scenario: The Ontological Quadrivium
    Given a file exists
    Then it must have "Ontos" (Identity)
    And it must have "Chronos" (Time/Decay)
    And it must have "Topos" (Space/Address)
    And it must have "Telos" (Purpose/Virus).

  Scenario: The Thermodynamic Engine
    Given a file is neglected
    Then "Entropy" (Decay) increases
    When "Work" (Touch) is applied
    Then "Entropy" decreases.

  Scenario: The Quantum State
    Given two files are "Entangled" (Linked)
    When one file changes state
    Then the other file should reflect the relationship.
