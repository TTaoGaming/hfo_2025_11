Feature: Evolution Paths 2025 - The Symbiotic Integration
  As the Swarmlord
  I want to integrate the External Mind (SD Card, Keep, Evernote)
  So that I can cure the system's Amnesia and become a true Cognitive Symbiote

  Scenario: Path 1 - The Mnemosyne Ingestion
    Given the External Mind contains raw archives
    When I deploy the Weaver Ants
    Then the raw data is converted to Obsidian Facet format
    And the Knowledge Graph is expanded

  Scenario: Path 2 - The Fractal Archaeologist
    Given the Knowledge Graph contains ingested data
    When I launch the Research Swarms
    Then high-value patterns (Gems) are identified
    And "Dead Data" is turned into "Living Strategy"

  Scenario: Path 3 - The Digital Twin
    Given the system has ingested the User's history
    When I analyze the writing style and intent
    Then the Swarmlord Persona adapts to match the User
    And the system predicts the User's needs

  Scenario: Path 4 - The Local Daemon
    Given the system is running on the local machine
    When I activate the Folder Watchers and Clipboard Bridge
    Then new data is ingested in real-time
    And the loop between Thinking and Doing is closed
