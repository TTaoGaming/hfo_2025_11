> **Metaphor**: The Hippocampus / RAM.
> **Generation**: 53 (KCS v6)

This directory is for **Work In Progress (WIP)**. It is the "Inbox" of the Hive.

## 🔄 The KCS Solve Loop
1.  **Capture**: Agents log raw findings, drafts, and spikes here.
2.  **Structure**: The Assimilator (or you) refines these into Diátaxis artifacts.
3.  **Reuse**: The final artifacts move to `memory/library/`.

## 🗑️ Retention Policy
Files here are **ephemeral**. They should be:
*   Promoted to `memory/library/` (if valuable).
*   Archived to `memory/episodic/` (if logs).
*   Deleted (if noise).
