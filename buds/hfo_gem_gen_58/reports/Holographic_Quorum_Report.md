## 3. The Swarmlord's Decree (Level 1 Artifact)

**Synthesizer**: `x-ai/grok-4.1-fast:free`
**Consensus Score**: `0.75`

### 🔮 The Synthesis
The test_protocol.md (Protocol Alpha) establishes an inviolable foundational law mandating the perpetual and exclusive deployment of exactly eight agents for the Hive Fleet Obsidian's operational integrity. This axiomatic constraint is analyzed unanimously across eight dimensions: Ontos (core existential requirement of the 8-agent collective), Logos (absolute logical imperative without exception), Telos (purpose of standardized deployment for system stability and goals), Chronos (timeless, continuous applicability via 'always'), Pathos (authoritative, compliance-evoking tone), Ethos (trust through rigid predictability and reliability), Topos (fixed hierarchical topology of 8 agents), Nomos (binding legal constraint with zero tolerance for deviation).

### ⚔️ Resolved Conflicts
- Minor Chronos discrepancies (no sequence vs. perpetual) resolved to continuous obligation.
- Pathos/Topos variations (minimal emotional/physical details vs. structural implications) unified under core 8-agent mandate.
