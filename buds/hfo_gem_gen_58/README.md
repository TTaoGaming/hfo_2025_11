# Hive Fleet Obsidian: Generation 58 (Recovery)

This generation is a clean slate recovery following a Sybil attack on the previous memory structures.

## Structure
This generation maintains the 8-fold Octree structure derived from Generation 57:

1. **blood/**
2. **brain/**
3. **effectors/**
4. **immune_system/**
5. **memory/**
6. **nerves/**
7. **sensors/**
8. **venom/**

## Intent
To rebuild and stabilize the system free from "AI slop" and corruption.
