bluf: Verification test confirming Obsidian Swarm's Header Swarm generates accurate
  Stigmergy Holon Headers via deep semantic understanding of AI swarm content.
story: This markdown file serves as a controlled test case for the Obsidian Swarm's
  Header Swarm agents, evaluating their ability to parse content, achieve deep semantic
  comprehension of AI, swarms, and stigmergy concepts, and produce structured Holon
  Headers for stigmergic knowledge management.

# Test File for Header Swarm

This is a test file to verify that the Header Swarm can generate a valid Stigmergy Header.
It contains some random thoughts about AI and swarms.

The swarm should be able to read this, understand it's about testing, and generate a header.
