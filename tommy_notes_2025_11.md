ok  Now we need to talk about the HFO level one loop which is based on 10 agents and the mnemonic is Swarm Swarm. It is based off of D3A plus IT. So what it is, it's it's set, which is the user and the orchestrator would set the mission intent, mission constraints, etcetera, right? Then we would have watch and have monitoring and being able to see sort of what's going on. And then it's act. So the action step would be the scatter and gather step. And then our stands for review, which should be our verification, validation, static test, making sure everything passes right the review. Is this an actual valid thing? Do we have byzantine quorum? We assume that persistent green is a code smell. In fact, what we can do in the review step is to inject. One disruptor that should sneak through because it has access to the back end of the code and within the review step. We should also have the immunizers that will essentially catch that, but there's different classes of immunizers, so the disruptor should pass at least a few of the immunizers. And then the last step is the mutation step, which is the evolution step. It is the Co evolution between red and blue team so that the system gets more and more hardened over time. The ideas that we are not algorithm or vendor locked in, we can always switch for different algorithms like the AX that can right now use scatter gather, but later the act step can do something completely different. That's fine. The idea is to set the intention, watch and have observability to act and do the thing to review to see if things are going well. Especially with Byzantine quorum and a large cohort, we assume that 100 percent confidence is a hallucination. We. Max out at 90% confidence. And will always inject at least one disruptor within that cohort. For example, because AI hallucinates all the time and I don't have a system to be able to catch the AI hallucinating by itself. Rather I'm gonna be using an adversarial Byzantine quorum with probably some kind of history and confidence waiting in the future to. Improve the system as well. And then also to use evolutionary algorithms like Mapali to create quality diversity, to do things like evolutionary tuning, to use things like open evolve to essentially do hyper heuristic meta evolution of the loop as well. It's not just one static run. The idea is that using a combination of the memory system and a network virtual stigma G layer like using Nats jet stream for the different cohort to be able to communicate with each other as well. This is a very layered concept that I need you to help me simplify it down. This is all based on existing research. There is zero invention. It is all composition, so you should be able to pull really good information from existing research to use here.
